Yeah. Let\\'s put these on. Pretend we\\'re professional. What\\'s up? Good to see\\n00:00:21.600 you, man. Thanks so much for having me. Appreciate my pleasure being here. And there\\'s no way I\\'m having a pro wrestler on without Tony Hinchcliffe.\\n00:00:28.720 possible. He\\'s the expert. He knows more about pro wrestling than I know about UFC. Yeah, sometimes I translate little\\n00:00:35.440 things here and there. That\\'s cool. It\\'s all right. Yeah, he has to. He has to. And he\\'s a giant fan of yours, too. You know, a\\n00:00:41.200 giant fan of yours is Brian Simpson. Brian Simpson was going on last night about how intelligent you are. It was\\n00:00:46.800 really interesting, you know. Sure was me. Yeah, man. Well, you do speak [\\xa0__\\xa0] Mandarin,\\n00:00:52.800 which is kind of crazy. Uh, yeah. Yeah. How long did it take you to learn that? Uh man, I I was I was doing that for\\n00:00:59.920 quite a long time. I\\'ve since kind of um kind of declined on the studies. Uh I a\\n00:01:06.000 wonderful takeaway from the study of Mandarin. Um just because you know a language doesn\\'t mean you know the\\n00:01:11.600 culture. Ah so that was a fantastic experience with I but I I studied Mandarin for like a decade and I would say like um not even\\n00:01:19.600 conversationally fluent. It was a really tough hill to climb for me. But it seems like a really big hill.\\n00:01:25.600 Just it\\'s it\\'s just different. You know, you get used to the language and the structure. You read it, you know, the reading.\\n00:01:30.799 No, I didn\\'t even bother to read and uh like reading all the characters, understanding everything. Yeah. How long did it take you to learn?\\n00:01:37.040 Around 10 years. Whoa. Yeah. And then like I mean I I would dream in Mandarin and like have\\n00:01:43.280 conversations and kick down and that. So it became like a like a a second language. But you know I I lived in\\n00:01:50.320 China for a little bit. I filmed a movie with Jackie Chan. So I was there for like six or seven months. I lived there in um man we were in Inner Mongolia,\\n00:01:57.439 Yinchuan Province. So like like in China. Wow. And uh it was fun. Yeah. Yeah.\\n00:02:03.360 You were in Mongolia. Inner Inner Mongolia. Yeah. What\\'s the difference? Uh I don\\'t know cuz I\\'ve never I\\'ve\\n00:02:09.598 never been in Mongolia, but Inner Mongolia was uh man I was I was the only person that looked like me there. Uh and\\n00:02:15.920 everyone would say look it\\'s it\\'s big white guy Hyundai Byron. and that would call me.\\n00:02:20.959 Wow. Yeah. Wow. So, what motivated you to learn that? It seems like such a task.\\n00:02:26.720 Honestly, man, it was everything in my life seems to be wrestling related. It was wrestling related. Like WWE\\'s um\\n00:02:33.680 reach spread everywhere. I mean, I\\' I\\'ve been able to lucky enough to perform everywhere from like Moscow,\\n00:02:39.760 Philippines, South Africa, Bangor, Maine, you every place in between except China. China was like the one place that\\n00:02:47.200 didn\\'t understand what we did. So it it\\'s literally like it\\'s a it\\'s a universal language because you can turn\\n00:02:53.360 it\\'s like UFC like you turn the volume down but you can see like oh this is two guys best guy wins. I get it. Uh ch the\\n00:03:00.480 Chinese didn\\'t get it. So I figured if like one of our superstars spoke the language maybe that would help break\\n00:03:06.800 down the barrier. And we got in your idea. Uh it was my idea but the WWE offers and I think they still offer it. they they\\n00:03:13.280 offer a free second language program. So like when they rolled out the initiative of like financial advice and um you know\\n00:03:20.560 uh they\\'ll pay for portions of your secondary education and free second language. This is like 2011\\n00:03:27.680 2012 big talent meeting in like an auditorium. I\\'m one of the old guys at the time sitting in the front being like\\n00:03:33.360 these kids don\\'t know how good they have it. I should stand up and tell them to like no [\\xa0__\\xa0] that. I\\'m actually going to\\n00:03:38.720 lead by example and take a language. So I signed up right then then and there for China Chinese because I wanted to\\n00:03:45.120 get us into China. Wow. And like I said, it worked, but it kind of only worked. And they I think I think\\n00:03:51.920 actually right now China is experiencing what wrestling is to them cuz like there\\'s I\\'ve read articles that there\\'s\\n00:03:58.480 promotions over there that are thriving. So like now they get it. Oh, so they have their own promotions.\\n00:04:03.760 Yeah. Yeah. This is a fairly recent thing, I think. So, like I just read recent articles that like pro wrestling is\\n00:04:09.360 thriving in China and they have their own like their own way of doing it. Wow. Yeah. Yeah.\\n00:04:14.560 Wow. That\\'s wild. It\\'s wild how like expansive the pro wrestling business is\\n00:04:22.400 that they would be that o-minded to say like let\\'s let\\'s give second language\\n00:04:28.400 programs to the athletes. Well, and you know, I just it\\'s it\\'s weird. The origins of the business are\\n00:04:34.240 carnival related. it as like a carnival attraction and then uh it it was like ruthlessly territorial\\n00:04:40.080 and then when it became national it was still trying to find its way. It\\'s it\\'s almost like you see pro sports doing it. You know the more a sport succeeds the\\n00:04:47.680 more benefits they offer to their competitors and athletes. So you know WWE kind of hit that stride. Yeah.\\n00:04:55.280 It\\'s just such a smart thing to do you know. Yeah. Well, you give your ch give your talent the opportunities to to gain\\n00:05:02.240 knowledge and and wisdom. And the sad thing is I don\\'t know how many people did it or or do it still, you know.\\n00:05:08.479 Was there anybody other than you that you know of that two other people? Who? Uh Clauddio Castnoli who speaks I think\\n00:05:15.120 four or five languages already and he just wanted to take like a brush up course and uh Natty Nightheart.\\n00:05:21.440 Wow. Yeah, that\\'s it. Everybody else is like not going to do it. Too much work.\\n00:05:26.560 Yeah. What was the not knowing the culture aspect of that? So, man, I got I got put in a bit of a\\n00:05:32.400 hot spot with um uh I I I I made a a pack to myself when I was like, \"Okay, I\\n00:05:39.360 feel fluent.\" We would do these global press tours and I just happened to be on a global press tour and I\\'m like, \"You know what? I\\'m going to do 70% of my\\n00:05:47.520 media in Mandarin, like in dialogue.\" And I got to say, I did it. Like I went\\n00:05:53.600 over there, spoke, people were taking off the translator headphones. Like life was good, everything was great. And at\\n00:05:58.800 the very end of the day, as with all these press tours, you do like a bunch of prompter reads. So I\\'m doing prompter\\n00:06:04.880 reads for everywhere. And it\\'s like, um, hey, go this place and see this movie. Go this place and see this movie. And\\n00:06:10.639 no, my bad. I didn\\'t check the reads because it\\'s like an end of a 10-hour day. You do a million of these things.\\n00:06:17.680 And one of them said like, \"Hey, uh, Taiwan, see this this and and uh the the\\n00:06:24.319 it was all in Mandarin and the opinion described Taiwan as a country. So be the\\n00:06:30.000 first country to see this.\" Now over there, they they look through a different lens like geopolitics are\\n00:06:36.800 murky waters, man. And that\\'s what when I learned of like I just said it, left,\\n00:06:41.919 everybody was cool, I did my thing. Like I I read the prompt. It was like a Ron Burgundy moment. Like go [\\xa0__\\xa0] yourself, San Diego. was like the most offensive\\n00:06:48.080 thing you can say. So I\\'m like, man, you know, good job, John. You you said you you did 70% and\\n00:06:54.400 people understood what you were talking about. And then they put that out and everybody was like, what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did\\n00:07:00.319 you just say? We don\\'t that\\'s not how we do it over here. And again, just cuz\\n00:07:05.520 like my takeaway and it was a it it was a pretty tense moment for me. Like I had to apologize to China. And in\\n00:07:11.840 apologizing to China, I I pissed off my home country. I\\'m a patriot. I love the United States of America and everything\\n00:07:18.319 it stands for, but like no one it was never enough. Nobody was happy. Everybody was [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. And it was it\\n00:07:25.039 was it was like murky waters for me personally. And I it was weird. Like I\\'m the I think I might have been the only\\n00:07:31.440 guy almost to get cancelceled for doing his homework, you know, like for trying to like learn like learn and and try to do something.\\n00:07:37.599 But the cool takeaway, you know, we can learn from every mistake. My mistake was just because you know the language\\n00:07:43.120 doesn\\'t mean you know the culture. Do they even refer to as Taiwan? I think they referred to as Chinese Taipei, right?\\n00:07:48.319 Man, what was in the I know what I read in in the thing. So that\\'s again I don\\'t\\n00:07:54.080 know enough depth to know that and now like people like oh man can you can you speak Mandarin for this? I\\n00:08:00.560 just won\\'t do it. It\\'s a skill that I have and it\\'s but it\\'s a skill that\\'s going to remain with me because it\\'s I don\\'t understand. I\\n00:08:06.800 don\\'t have the depth of field to know what to call that place in that region of the world and I haven\\'t done enough\\n00:08:12.319 research and I don\\'t have the wisdom and I don\\'t have like the the cultural fluency, you know. So, it was a cool lesson. It it sucked\\n00:08:19.680 cuz I thought I was just trying to do something good, but it was it was a cool lesson. Was it really that big of a deal,\\n00:08:25.360 man? I thought like I I I was filming Peacemaker season 1 and when they came\\n00:08:30.560 out with all of this stuff, I went directly to James Gunn and was like, \"Hey man, if you have to fire me, I I\\n00:08:36.320 understand.\" Wow. And uh it was that serious. But it wasn\\'t even words that you wrote. Someone the WWE\\n00:08:43.440 wrote it. That doesn\\'t No, no, it was it was for the movie I was promoting, right? So the movie the people that made the movie wrote it. So I don\\'t know like\\n00:08:49.839 when you do these press tours let\\'s say if I\\'m doing a movie for Warner Brothers let\\'s say let\\'s use Peacemaker as an\\n00:08:55.120 example I\\'m doing a global Peacemaker tour and we go into China or we go into South\\n00:09:00.160 America you meet like the PR person there and they have all the stuff you\\'re supposed to do and they curate your experience\\n00:09:06.240 and they hold your hand you like okay now we\\'re going to go to this station then by the way they just want you to do some shoutouts. So anytime I go anywhere\\n00:09:13.200 globally now, as much as I want to um thank fans for\\n00:09:18.240 their attention and you know investing in the product, I really shy away from like speaking the language because I\\n00:09:24.320 don\\'t understand the cultural nuance. You know, I just I just want to be like, yo, thanks for watching what we do and I love the fact that you\\'re entertained,\\n00:09:30.880 but I want to speak to you at a level that I understand that I\\'m fluent cuz your boots on the ground here every day and I might say something that\\'s a nice\\n00:09:37.360 gesture but completely [\\xa0__\\xa0] offend you. And that\\'s that\\'s not good. That\\'s not good for anybody.\\n00:09:42.480 So, was the teleprompter in English and you translate to No, everything was in Mandarin. And in\\n00:09:48.000 uh in Chinese, they have the characters, which are virtually impossible for me to learn. There\\'s like an infinite number,\\n00:09:54.240 but they have they also have what\\'s called pin yin, which is it\\'s kind of spelled out in English with phonetics.\\n00:09:59.440 So, it has the four tones. Okay. So, if you were to put something in front of me in pinion right now, I could definitely read it.\\n00:10:05.279 And I got good at reading pin yin. So I was like, man, I could I could send all these messages in manner and then more\\n00:10:11.200 people will know about this movie and more people will know about me and more people will know about wrestling and more people be excited. Looked good on\\n00:10:18.160 paper. It just my followrough was a bit weak. You know, it doesn\\'t even seem like that was your\\n00:10:23.360 fault, right? It\\'s probably a PR\\'s assistant assistant that\\'s type that\\'s probably in\\n00:10:28.880 charge of doing the grunt work of typing in all the different languages and the different countries. Like it\\'s tedious.\\n00:10:34.240 you uh uh from from what I know I know I\\'m going to learn a lot about you guys in this episode, but from what I know\\n00:10:39.279 about you, you\\'re you\\'re into looking at looking at things through different lenses and different perspectives. It\\n00:10:44.399 also could have been somebody being like I\\'m going to get this kid. Oo, but here\\'s the thing. I I do appreciate\\n00:10:51.600 you saying like it\\'s not your fault. That\\'s not true. It was my fault. And I think that\\'s when I can start to work on\\n00:10:57.920 like, well, what did I learn from this? And I could easily blame a PR, an assistant. I could say somebody had a\\n00:11:04.800 target on my back. All that stuff. I [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. Did you suspect that somebody might have\\n00:11:10.880 set you up? No. Well, you\\'re saying it like it\\'s a possibility. Well, man, when it happened, every every\\n00:11:18.160 theory came like here\\'s the thing. The world doesn\\'t revolve around me, but my little world, everybody was like, \"They\\n00:11:24.880 [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. They did this on purpose.\" I was like, \"Well, first of all, who\\'s they?\" So, I was able to kind of eliminate all that. And once I realized\\n00:11:31.920 I could still go on working, uh, I I really made a lot of people angry. And for that, that then I\\'m sorry. Like\\n00:11:37.360 again, I was just trying to That\\'s crazy just by saying that Taiwan\\'s a country in in Chinese though,\\n00:11:43.600 right? You know, like those are murky waters to begin with, you know, like I I\\'m not even thoroughly fluent on the US\\n00:11:50.880 policy. I think it\\'s like like a territorial ambiguity or some [\\xa0__\\xa0] like that. Like it\\'s it\\'s so weird\\n00:11:57.040 and it\\'s it\\'s so fragile and I I uh I got into some water I shouldn\\'t have been swimming in. But that\\'s that\\'s\\n00:12:03.279 on me. It\\'s not it was my fault and and I think that\\'s important for me to bear the burden of that and be like,\\n00:12:09.360 \"Yo, what how can I course correct? What did I learn? Who do I really really genuinely have to apologize for\\n00:12:15.279 offending?\" The the biggest thing that was a kick to the nuts is when like people state side got pissed off\\n00:12:22.399 because you apologized. Yes. in in Chinese and and I understand it. I mean, completely like\\n00:12:29.120 bowing down to the demand of this that gosh, what a what a shitty move by me.\\n00:12:34.320 Like I just I should have taken a breath. Again, what did I learn? Don\\'t be reactive.\\n00:12:40.000 Mhm. Take a breath, find out what\\'s going on, find out the best path of action, maybe\\n00:12:45.600 give it a few days, maybe give it a hot second, um, and then move forward. But immediately I\\n00:12:51.360 was like, \"Oh, they\\'re mad. You want us to do this? Fine, no problem. I\\'ll fix it right now. Man, that not only did I\\n00:12:57.200 not try to fix the hole in the boat, I sunk the Titanic. So, it was But again, it was a learning experience.\\n00:13:03.120 Well, it speaks to your character that you don\\'t blame anybody else cuz I blame everybody else. I\\'m like, who [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n00:13:09.200 wrote that? Don\\'t you don\\'t you know what you\\'re saying or what you\\'re making me say?\\n00:13:14.480 Uh, the the release you guys have for the show, I I read it and you\\'re You might be the only person. So that\\n00:13:20.880 was that was whoever handed it to me. That was what they said. Like I think you might be the only person that\\'s ever read it. Yeah.\\n00:13:25.920 Man, if if if you\\'re gonna if you\\'re gonna take liberties with me, at least I want to be able to read that you are.\\n00:13:31.600 Right. You know what I\\'m saying? And I I can\\'t say I\\'m perfect with doing that, but like I was handed a release. I\\'m like, \"Man, can I just glance this over for\\n00:13:39.040 Oh, this says what I think it says. Okay, let\\'s go.\" Trump didn\\'t even read it. Just\\n00:13:46.399 to each their own. Yeah. know it\\'s very smart of you to read it. You know who who knows, you\\n00:13:51.760 know. Who knows? So, this is uh Tony, is this is this the full trifecta now? Is like if you\\'ve\\n00:13:57.920 gotten all of your heroes on this podcast now? There\\'s a couple more we could knock off out of the pro wrestling world. There\\'s\\n00:14:04.480 a couple more. Talk, if if you don\\'t mind, if I can indulge, talk pro wrestling heroes. Who\\n00:14:09.920 Who do we need to knock off? Who do we need? Well, I mean, in all reality, and it\\'s a\\n00:14:15.120 diabolical diabolical And he can he kind of invite he you can\\'t you can invite anyone you want in here. You just kind\\n00:14:21.839 of got to get him the wish list. I mean you got to you got to start with the number one without a doubt Vince McMahon who started this gangster [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n00:14:29.040 and spread it around. I would definitely have him is a little man I he would be great.\\n00:14:34.399 Yes. I whatever magic you have out there and you have a lot of gravity.\\n00:14:39.680 Do you think he\\'d be interested in doing it? Are you kidding me? I think he would love it. Really? I think he would love it. I I don\\'t know\\n00:14:45.839 when the right time is, but man, don\\'t don\\'t miss out on that. At least at least send it out to the\\n00:14:52.320 universe. Yeah. Well, I would definitely Vince, if you\\'re listening, Vince, if you\\'re listening, let\\'s go. I think this would be a great I think\\n00:14:58.320 this experience would be a great one for you. Is he still involved? Is he out? Is he in? He\\'s out.\\n00:15:04.160 He\\'s out. He\\'s out totally. Yep. It seems like he\\'s a guy that\\'ll be out for a little while and then something will happen that\\'ll bring him back in.\\n00:15:10.639 No, I Well, well, I don\\'t know. again. That\\'s that\\'s way we were talking about like\\n00:15:15.680 why is your last event in this place? I\\'m like, man, because I don\\'t choose the events. Like I don\\'t that all that stuff is so far above me, but I know now\\n00:15:24.560 he\\'s out. I I in my eyes, I I\\'d like to think that like time heals everything\\n00:15:30.880 and I believe in forgiveness and uh I also believe in like looking at the body\\n00:15:36.320 of work, but I also know there\\'s a lot of fragile stuff going on there. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know, man. I don\\'t know.\\n00:15:41.360 Yeah, it\\'s a hot subject. It It can get us into another Chinese Taipei incident.\\n00:15:46.560 Well, no, no, I man, I\\'m I\\'m again I\\'ve I\\'ve learned to become a little bit more\\n00:15:51.600 accountable for for what I say and and just how just because I feel a certain way about a person doesn\\'t exonerate\\n00:15:57.600 them from being accountable for their actions, right? And just because he did start quote unquote all this\\n00:16:04.000 gangster [\\xa0__\\xa0] uh that doesn\\'t that doesn\\'t mean he doesn\\'t need to be accountable for his actions. So, let\\'s let\\'s figure out what\\n00:16:10.560 that means and then figure out if we can if we can move forward and and and bring\\n00:16:15.680 that back in the fold or if if it stays the way it is. What do you think, Tony? You think he\\'s coming back? I think he would come here.\\n00:16:21.839 Yeah, I think he would come here, too. And I think he you know, that\\'s one of the more entertaining people of all time. He created the entire universe.\\n00:16:28.560 So, you got to remember Hogan\\'s Hogan because of him. Cena is seen because of him. Yeah. Every single stone cold he\\'s like,\\n00:16:34.959 \"That sounds good. Yeah, keep it going. We\\'ll do the glass breaks thing and they\\'ll throw you beers. I like it. Let\\'s do it again next week. So\\n00:16:41.120 everything that we think when he sits here, you got to do that impression. Yeah.\\n00:16:46.800 Yeah. Uh yeah. Stone Cold\\'s another one that hasn\\'t been on. Steve would be great. I think you you\\n00:16:53.600 would you would dig Steve. Oh yeah, I\\'m sure. Yeah. He lives out here, too, doesn\\'t he? Yep. Does he?\\n00:16:59.120 Well, actually, no. Doesn\\'t he have a ranch out here? I think he does somewhere. I think he does. Yeah, but I think he\\'s based out of\\n00:17:05.359 somewhere else now. New Mexico or Arizona. He\\'s on the He like He\\'s like kind of cool and reclusive. He like\\n00:17:12.000 doesn\\'t really do a lot. It\\'s amazing. He\\'d be a good get and I I\\'m pretty I guarantee you he would do it. Yeah.\\n00:17:17.760 Steve, if you\\'re I know you\\'re watching. Come on. Come on. Come on in.

Well, you don\\'t if you don\\'t know the history, Tony at one\\n00:19:18.880 point in time was offered a job with the WWE before he really made it. No way. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. He was offered a job\\n00:19:24.480 to write for the WWE because, you know, Tony was a giant pro wrestling fan and\\n00:19:30.080 you know, he\\'d already had a Netflix special so he was known as a Before that. Was it before the Netflix special?\\n00:19:36.640 The first one? The one that you released yourself? Yeah. Really? Yeah. It was only a couple years into me\\n00:19:41.760 doing standup like seven nights a week at the comedy store all the time. And somehow I ended up someone\\'s like, \"Hey,\\n00:19:47.679 I have a friend in WWE if you want to have a meeting with them and just talk.\" And I went in with straight up ideas.\\n00:19:53.679 This that the undertaker\\'s brother comes back again. This that the next like everything back and forth. I can\\'t even\\n00:20:00.240 remember any of them. It\\'s been so long. But I went in with the whole thing. This guy\\'s like, \"Where the hell did you like\\n00:20:05.520 what? This is crazy. You just like did this.\" I\\'m like, \"Yeah, I found out a couple days ago we were going to talk.\"\\n00:20:10.559 So, but yeah, they offered it, but I would have had to move to Connecticut\\n00:20:15.919 and take a train to New York every night to do go do standup. And that would have just been exhausting. And everything I\\n00:20:22.320 heard because Patrice O\\'Neal, the late great Patrice O\\'Neal, wrote for WWE for a while.\\n00:20:27.520 Did he really? Yeah. Yeah. For like a couple years, I think. What did he just wrote lines for them? Like, what did he do?\\n00:20:33.120 The whole shebang. When you\\'re a WWE writer, they they make you write. It\\'s not like a cute job at all. No, there\\'s\\n00:20:40.320 a lot of there\\'s a lot of television or there\\'s a lot of content every week. Yeah. Right now, I think they got they have\\n00:20:45.840 three weekly shows. So, that\\'s 20 I think one of them\\'s going back to three hours, 16 like it\\'s\\n00:20:52.720 like 50 segments of TV. Yeah. Every week. Yeah. But I remember when you were talking about it.\\n00:20:58.080 Yeah. When you\\'re talking about potentially doing it, I was like, Yeah. It was tricky. And I was like, dude, you do not want to\\n00:21:04.240 live in Connecticut. No. That\\'s the main thing. If it was anywhere else other than Connecticut, it\\n00:21:09.440 kind of m would have made more sense. If it was in New York City, it would have been a no-brainer. If it was in LA,\\n00:21:15.440 definitely. But like, fast forward now. You\\'re you\\'re more and more involved. Yes. Well, this is the crazy thing. Like, we\\n00:21:21.679 had talked like during the the old days, like we would talk in the green room. I\\'d be like, that would be your ultimate\\n00:21:28.080 dream job, like to make it as a comedian and somehow be involved in the UFC the way I or excuse me, in WWE the way I\\'m\\n00:21:34.880 involved in the UFC. like very similar. Yeah, it\\'s look crazy. It\\'s insane.\\n00:21:41.120 I\\'m going tomorrow night. I\\'m going to be in the front row at the arena in my hometown. Are they here at the moment?\\n00:21:47.440 Oh, man. Are you messing with me? Are you going to Is your music going to hit your No, I\\'m not there. I\\'m I got one.\\n00:21:53.120 This is what This is what they do, by the way. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. This is what I didn\\'t even know they were going to be in town.\\n00:21:58.799 He\\'s correct. There\\'s a lot of You mess with people. You\\'re right. But then somebody like me will actually shoot you\\n00:22:05.039 straight and be like, \"I\\'m not going to be there and I won\\'t be there.\" And you\\'ll be like, \"Ah, now I\\'m just I\\'m building the equity for people to mess\\n00:22:10.880 with people.\" I\\'m giving 20 20 mulligans out there tomorrow.\\n00:22:16.000 Not a chance. Exactly. I heard a great story. You\\'ll probably love this. You might even know this story, but um the Undertaker, his\\n00:22:23.360 wife, and his podcast co-host went to Wrestlemania. They\\'re up in a fancy suite. This was um which one was it? The\\n00:22:30.559 Rock made an appearance. Did you? Yes, you were there, right? This that huge finish at Wrestlemania like three years\\n00:22:37.280 ago where it was just boom boom boom boom and all these legends were coming out this huge finish just like they they\\n00:22:44.159 can\\'t even like follow it. The ultimate climax of a Wrestlemania and one\\n00:22:49.360 wrestler comes out interrupts this huge main event and then another one then another one. Anyway, the Undertaker, his wife and his podcast co-host were up in\\n00:22:55.840 the suite. Undertaker goes, \"I\\'m going to go use the restroom.\" They\\'re like, \"He\\'s been gone a while.\" The lights go\\n00:23:01.039 out, the bell tools. They\\'re watching from the suite. He\\'s been gone for like 10 minutes, 20 minutes. He went and changed real quick. And then now he\\'s\\n00:23:07.520 came out as the Undertaker. Yeah. Came out as the Undertaker. They\\'re in the suite like, \"Oh my god, it\\'s the Undertaker.\"\\n00:23:13.679 Like they don\\'t tell anybody. It\\'s so old school and awesome that they keep secrets so locked up that their own\\n00:23:20.799 loved ones, his wife, didn\\'t even know. That\\'s hilarious. That is so crazy.\\n00:23:26.640 It\\'s It\\'s fun to be able to surprise a live audience. Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I mean, it\\'s got to be a big part of it. How did\\n00:23:32.559 you get involved in pro wrestling? Were you Were you a fan as a kid and then? I sure was. I I think we have the same\\n00:23:38.559 gravity of like, man, I was a super fan as a kid, but then I fell out of it\\n00:23:43.679 admittedly kind of when Hogan went to WCW. Um, so like I was into wrestling and\\n00:23:50.640 then I wasn\\'t. Then I got into sports or whatever. Uh, and then I got back into wrestling when everyone else did when\\n00:23:56.720 like Stone Cold Steve Austin became big. the rock became big. The attitude era hit and I was just um working a dead end job\\n00:24:03.679 over at Gold\\'s Gym Venice and like didn\\'t know what I wanted to do with my life. How old were you? Uh 21.\\n00:24:09.919 Wow. 21. I\\'d moved out to to California not to be famous or anything. My degree was in Kinesise and I wanted to like that\\n00:24:17.039 was the center of the fitness universe in 99 2000. So like all equipment\\n00:24:22.480 manufacturers are there. I\\'m like, man, I\\'ll go get a job with Hammer Strength or Cybex or like maybe Golds or like put that piece of\\n00:24:29.440 paper to on the wall to to like get a good paying job. It did not work. So, I ended up like front desk cleaning\\n00:24:36.880 toilets, selling protein bars in that order. So, don\\'t ever buy a protein bar. I\\'m just kidding. I\\'m just kidding. But\\n00:24:41.919 no, I was kind of like a jack of all trades over there. Um and a a friend of mine, um Chris Bell and Mark Bell.\\n00:24:48.400 Oh, I know those guys. Yeah. Yeah. They literally were like, \"Dude, you talk about WWF all the time.\\n00:24:53.679 You know, we train down in Orange County.\" And at that time, Chris Bell was kind of like writing for this promotion.\\n00:24:59.600 Like, would you want to do it? And I, man, I that doesn\\'t happen without them accidentally saying like, \"Yo, we we\\n00:25:06.640 trained to do this.\" So, his documentaries are [\\xa0__\\xa0] incredible. Bigger, stronger, faster.\\n00:25:11.679 And then the other one, the pill one. What was that one called? Magic pill. No. What was the one the the addiction one\\n00:25:18.320 uh that Chris released? But um Bigger, Stronger, Faster is such a [\\xa0__\\xa0] great\\n00:25:23.360 documentary. The Bell family. I\\'ve been I\\'ve been friends with them for a long time. Great guys. Yeah, that that documentary like blew the lid\\n00:25:30.320 off of like the reality of steroids. Prescription Thugscription is another great one.\\n00:25:36.000 Yeah. Crazy thing is he got addicted to pills while he was doing that because he had surgery while he was doing that and\\n00:25:42.880 got addicted to pills while he\\'s making a [\\xa0__\\xa0] documentary on people being addicted to pills. That\\'s how potent\\n00:25:49.360 pills are. A guy making a documentary about addiction.\\n00:25:54.880 He just thinks, \"Well, I\\'m just taking these cuz I got hip surgery and I\\'m in in [\\xa0__\\xa0] agony.\" And then gets hooked.\\n00:26:00.320 Oh, yeah. Like that\\'s how crazy it is. Yeah. They\\'re strong. Yeah. I would imagine.\\n00:26:06.880 Did you ever have an issue? No. No. As a matter of fact, uh I\\'ve I\\'ve had fusion in my neck, right pec\\n00:26:14.720 completely detached, reattached, both triceps reattached. Uh both triceps scoped.\\n00:26:20.480 Um nose relocated. Like I I got I probably I\\'m in like 10 physical surgeries where\\n00:26:27.919 they got to go and correct something. Never taken one uh pain pill. Wow. I have all the prescriptions in the\\n00:26:34.240 bottom drawer of my house filled. And and it\\'s weird because at every facility, the first thing they the first\\n00:26:41.520 hill they climb is pain management. You wake up from anesthesia, you\\'re like gray and murky. And I\\'ve been in a bunch\\n00:26:48.559 of surgeries at a bunch of different facilities. The protocol is always the same. Do you want something for the pain? Here, we got to make sure you take\\n00:26:54.720 this with you because you\\'re not in any pain. Yeah. Like I I understand because you if you leave, if you\\'re feeling okay, maybe\\n00:27:01.039 you\\'re high off adrenaline, I don\\'t know. And then the operation sets in of like, holy [\\xa0__\\xa0] this is a 10 out of 10.\\n00:27:07.679 I can\\'t I need something. I get that. But I I guess from falling down and\\n00:27:13.600 hurting my body a lot, like I know my pain threshold. Yeah. And when I the the worst one was\\n00:27:19.520 probably the putting the whole pec back on and then attaching it, but when I woke up I was able to like mess around\\n00:27:25.520 with the stress ball and I never took one pill. That\\'s amazing. And I I still have the the full bottles\\n00:27:31.679 of like some are labeled 2008 is when I had my first surgery and they\\'re just all there. There\\'s a lot of people listening right\\n00:27:37.200 now going count them all if they\\'re still good. But the find out where John Cena stores\\n00:27:43.279 to them. Yeah, it was weird because the medical staff couldn\\'t couldn\\'t believe it. Like they\\'re like, \"You don\\'t want anything.\"\\n00:27:49.120 No, because man, it\\'s a I know how I am with this. It\\'s Yeah, it\\'s a [\\xa0__\\xa0] slippery road.\\n00:27:54.240 And I would just I\\'d be high on opiates. All opioids all the time. I got my first knee surgery, I think, in\\n00:28:00.559 93 or 94, and they gave me I got an ACL reconstruction, and they gave me\\n00:28:05.679 Vicodin, I think. Pretty sure it was Vicodin. I took one one day, and I felt so stupid. I was lying on lying on my\\n00:28:14.000 couch watching TV and I felt so dumb. And my knee still hurt, you know? It was\\n00:28:19.360 just like it was distracting me from the fact that my knee hurt, but I\\'m like, I can\\'t be this dumb. I\\'m dumb enough as\\n00:28:24.880 it is. I can\\'t add to my dumbness with pills. Like, I just saw it coming, you\\n00:28:30.399 know? And also, I knew a bunch of guys who had pill problems. I w up selling my pills to a friend of mine that would\\n00:28:36.240 sell pills. Gosh, I I should have taken your idea. Could have made some cash. I only made\\n00:28:41.520 like a couple hundred bucks or something. I don\\'t even remember. It was like in the 90s. But but I remember just that one pill. And so then every surgery\\n00:28:48.399 I\\'ve had ever since then. They always offered me stuff and I never took anything. I got my other ACL\\n00:28:53.440 reconstructed in 2003. Never took anything. I got in my nose fixed. It\\'s\\n00:28:59.279 like 2008. I got my nose reconstructed, deviated septum. The guy was insisting\\n00:29:05.360 that I he gave me two prescriptions for pain med medicine. And I was like, I don\\'t want anything. I was like, \"Is it\\n00:29:10.640 going to get worse than this?\" He\\'s like, \"It could get.\" I go, \"Right now, it feels like nothing.\" Yeah. It\\'s like, but if you\\'ve been, again,\\n00:29:16.480 like you, you\\'ve been beaten up so many times your body, you\\'re so used to just being in pain. And I think for some\\n00:29:23.039 people just the the daunting anxiety of pain itself. It\\'s like they just want a\\n00:29:28.399 pill before they even realize like I could kind of just Yeah, it sucks, but it\\'s not going to suck forever. It\\'s\\n00:29:34.320 going to heal. So, let\\'s just deal with the suck and just lay here. put some ice on it or whatever and just relax.\\n00:29:40.159 And uh along with that, it\\'s kind of like your your body\\'s natural way of saying like, \"Okay, maybe push a little\\n00:29:47.760 bit more. Try to get a few more degrees of range of motion in physical therapy.\" Like if if those senses are numbed,\\n00:29:55.039 right, and like shut off, right? First of all, you you do feel just like\\n00:30:00.399 I don\\'t want to do anything. you won\\'t work or in many cases you won\\'t work to do the work to get better to get or\\n00:30:06.159 you just numb. You don\\'t know the messaging. You can\\'t listen to your body. Like if it\\'s really really in pain,\\n00:30:12.240 maybe it\\'s maybe your body\\'s trying to tell you something. I don\\'t know. I always assume that people feel pain differently. I mean, I just would\\n00:30:18.480 imagine like like people feel hot sauce differently. Like some people they can\\'t\\n00:30:23.760 have any spice. Some people [\\xa0__\\xa0] can have like, you know, death peppers and they\\'re fine. So, all right. I\\'ll throw that out to\\n00:30:29.679 the group. Is pain a personal experience? I mean, there\\'s no way I\\'m as tough as you guys. So, yeah, it has to be.\\n00:30:36.799 But I think in other dimensions you might be way tougher. I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. Maybe I think I think\\n00:30:42.799 there\\'s something. You don\\'t know, Tony. I can\\'t imagine the dimension. I went and visited a firehouse the other\\n00:30:48.799 day and I was going down the pole going wee. Like you guys wouldn\\'t do that. I would do that.\\n00:30:54.000 So, so in that in that aspect, you\\'re tougher than me. Yeah. It can take ridicule and we can\\n00:30:59.919 take ridicule really easily, but I don\\'t know how what it feels like for other people. You know what I\\'m saying? I\\n00:31:05.120 mean, I would assume that everybody feels the same. But, you know, one of the reasons why I think maybe it is like\\n00:31:11.360 it\\'s different, but because my mom my mom has a crazy tolerance to pain. Like\\n00:31:16.480 my guy who uh my stem cell guy in LA uh my mom had a real knee issue and he was\\n00:31:23.039 treating her as well. And he goes, \"It\\'s hilarious. Your mother\\'s just like you. She just takes it like she doesn\\'t even flinch. She just stick it like he\\'s like\\n00:31:29.760 that doesn\\'t happen with like 75year-old ladies like take a needle and shove it in their knee and and push it and she\\n00:31:35.600 just doesn\\'t move and you know she\\'s like oh it wasn\\'t painful. It was no big deal. It\\'s like\\n00:31:41.120 you know a lot of 75 year old ladies would be [\\xa0__\\xa0] sweating and freaking out and seeing the needle. Pretty sure I would be. Yeah.\\n00:31:48.320 But I I I I don\\'t know you know I don\\'t know what it feels like to other people. But like when I got my ACL, my right ACL\\n00:31:55.679 reconstructed, it was a lot easier because it was a cadaavver. And I recommend it to anybody. The difference\\n00:32:00.720 between a patella tendon graph recovery and a cadaavver recovery is literally like six months. The difference is it\\'s\\n00:32:07.600 the cadaavver was so much quicker. Wow. Oh my god. Because the cadaavver they take it I mean it\\'s all swollen and\\n00:32:13.840 everything afterwards, but it\\'s somebody else\\'s tendon. They take an Achilles tendon off of a cadaavver. So it\\'s 150%\\n00:32:20.720 stronger than an ACL. They [\\xa0__\\xa0] screw that sucker in place. Little tiny orthoscopic holes, not nearly as\\n00:32:27.440 invasive. And then five days later, you know, Matt Likenberg, I went to his party for his birthday party 5 days\\n00:32:33.200 later just walking around and he was like, \"Did you just have surgery?\" I go, \"Yeah, like it\\'s not that big a deal, man. It feels fine.\"\\n00:32:39.840 You know, it\\'s it was so much easier. The left one was brutal cuz they take a slice out of your patella tendon and\\n00:32:45.760 then they could take a chunk out of your shin bone and a chunk out of your kneecap and then they use those to screw\\n00:32:51.360 this new tendon that they created into the shin bone and into your your thigh\\n00:32:56.399 bone. That was rough. That one was painful as [\\xa0__\\xa0] And it took a long time before it felt normal.\\n00:33:02.320 Took a long time before I could go down on one knee again. When was that pain? That was in the 90s.\\n00:33:07.679 And then the other one was 2000 early 2000s. 200 like twoish somewhere around that two three\\n00:33:13.279 I mean 10 more years of performing surgeries 10 more years of medical I just think it\\'s the diff because they still do that patella\\n00:33:19.360 tendon graph and I think George St. Pierre had it done that way. I know a bunch of people that I I\\'m friends with\\n00:33:24.880 had it done that way and I was like, \"Oh, don\\'t do that one.\" Yeah, do the cadaavver. But people are worried\\n00:33:30.159 like, \"What if you get AIDS?\" Like, you\\'re not Jesus Christ, you\\'re not going to get AIDS from it. Stop. And\\n00:33:35.679 it\\'s also it\\'s like you feel better before you are better, unfortunately, because the way the\\n00:33:42.080 tendon works. So, when they replace a tendon with a cadaavver, it\\'s not like you have this guy\\'s tendon in your body.\\n00:33:47.840 What it is like is that tendon is a scaffolding and then your body repoliferates that with your own cells.\\n00:33:54.480 So over the course of six months, my body had filled in all of what used to\\n00:34:00.320 be a cadaavver with my own cells. So you have you you\\'ll feel like it\\'s better\\n00:34:05.519 before it\\'s better. So a lot of MMA fighters, they re they start training\\n00:34:11.119 too quickly and they blow it out again because it\\'s still soft. That\\'s always the concern. It\\'s always\\n00:34:17.199 in any you feel good and you\\'re like, man, I can I can do this. Especially animals, you know, guys who\\n00:34:23.199 are just used to pain and used and used to pushing, you know, and they just pop\\n00:34:28.320 it out again. I know multiple MMA fighters that have had knee surgery and then blew it out while they were\\n00:34:34.159 recovering and just a few months more, they could just they\\'d be all right. But it\\'s impatience. You want to get back in\\n00:34:40.079 there. And then it\\'s even worse because you got to drill into the same holes and pull it out and open you up and it\\'s\\n00:34:46.480 more invasive surgery. They got to remove the screws and [\\xa0__\\xa0] Yeah. But I just I don\\'t think\\n00:34:52.960 everybody feels pain the same. I think it\\'s a genetic thing. I I\\'m It\\'s just an assumption obviously because I don\\'t\\n00:34:58.640 feel what other people feel. But I think some people just any kind of pain is just they can\\'t function. They\\'re\\n00:35:05.200 they\\'re just in agony. And I think those people are way more vulnerable to the pills.\\n00:35:10.800 That\\'s just my assumption. That\\'s a decent perspective. I definitely I I would agree with\\n00:35:17.440 pain is is a is a personal experience. Like there there are people who\\n00:35:23.359 I mean I\\'ve seen people like I can\\'t believe you go through that. And then people be like but you get the [\\xa0__\\xa0] kicked out of you. I can\\'t believe you\\n00:35:28.880 do that. It\\'s all it\\'s all relative. I would I would be [\\xa0__\\xa0] in cufflinks if you get that stem\\n00:35:35.119 cell needle out. I would be sweating right until the [\\xa0__\\xa0] final moment. Like some some stuff I can\\'t take, you\\n00:35:40.880 know? So I guess it is it could be combined with like what we fear in life or maybe\\n00:35:47.119 maybe fear of hard work or fear of effort. Who knows? I don\\'t know. I don\\'t know. I think it\\'s also being accustomed to\\n00:35:52.960 pain, you know. So if you did you wrestle when you were younger? No, I uh played football.\\n00:35:58.079 You played football. Well, that\\'s just like that in that you\\'re always in pain. I mean, if you\\'re playing football,\\n00:36:03.200 you\\'re always colliding with people. You\\'re always you got to have shoulders [\\xa0__\\xa0] with you, your backs [\\xa0__\\xa0] with you. It\\'s like it\\'s never ending.\\n00:36:09.760 I\\' I\\'ve always said that there\\'s something there\\'s some value into losing a fight. Oh yeah.\\n00:36:14.960 Like I grew up with four brothers and we kicked the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of each other and I\\'m I I was not always on the winning side. So very early on in my life as a\\n00:36:22.160 young person. You know what it\\'s like to lose a fight. Oh, it\\'s very valuable. And I think that that\\'s there\\'s a lot maybe to do with\\n00:36:27.920 the pain conversation there of like just flat out getting your ass kicked and then being able to dust yourself off and\\n00:36:33.760 be like, I\\'ll get you next time. You know, like it\\'s not over. You know what I\\'m saying? We\\'re brothers. We\\'re going to fight\\n00:36:39.280 again. You know, like that\\'s also knowing like why did he beat me? What can I do to beat him next time?\\n00:36:44.880 You know, like if you don\\'t have that in your life, also if you don\\'t know what it feels like to get your ass kicked,\\n00:36:50.000 you get a little mouthy. I mean, how many mouthy people do we know that have never been [\\xa0__\\xa0] up? And I think that\\'s\\n00:36:56.640 why like there\\'s real consequences if it actually comes down. You start yelling and you get mouthy. If it actually comes\\n00:37:03.200 down to it, and we\\'ve all seen many of these videos on the internet where someone just don\\'t they don\\'t know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n00:37:08.640 they\\'re asking for, what they\\'re getting into, and then all a sudden they\\'re getting hit. And man, I I\\'m not perfect and there are days where I\\'m short of\\n00:37:14.800 patience, but when it gets to that weird spot of like, yo, someone\\'s gonna get hit in the face. I always try to like\\n00:37:21.119 lean on diplomacy. Always. Always. Yeah. Please, let\\'s not do that cuz that [\\xa0__\\xa0] sucks.\\n00:37:26.640 And I bet a lot of people say to you, \"Man, if I was you, I\\'d be [\\xa0__\\xa0] everybody up.\" That\\'s the dumb people always say that. Like, it doesn\\'t end\\n00:37:33.359 with that. Then this guy gets his brother or he shoots you or they run you over with a car\\n00:37:38.640 or you think you\\'re going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] somebody up and you get [\\xa0__\\xa0] handled, right? Like you never know, man. You never know\\n00:37:44.320 anybody else\\'s story day. You never know to so many people out there that train\\n00:37:49.440 today. It\\'s so much different than when I was younger. Like you would assume that like I assume that a good solid 10%\\n00:37:56.480 of all men you meet have martial arts skills now because of the UFC popularity of it. Certainly certainly in\\n00:38:02.800 in western society it\\'s you know the gym there\\'s a gym every plaza also there\\'s so many kids that like\\n00:38:09.200 watch UFC and then play practice with themselves and you could learn a lot just doing that you guys learn a lot\\n00:38:16.800 just watching it on TV and then emulating it at home with their friends can tell those who watch WWE because\\n00:38:21.920 when those moments happen they try to do some crazy move doesn\\'t work doesn\\'t how many guys have [\\xa0__\\xa0] thrown their\\n00:38:27.119 buddy onto a conference table or something because they thought they thought it was the way into it.\\n00:38:32.480 It\\'s crazy, you know? I mean, the [\\xa0__\\xa0] sheer amount of punishment you guys put\\n00:38:37.680 yourself through is staggering. I mean, it really is staggering. But, uh, thank you very much. Uh, it is\\n00:38:44.560 is all for the good. Like, it\\'s like a a pro football player, pro hockey player, UFC. I think I think the beautiful\\n00:38:50.160 advantage that we have is that it\\'s we can we can make choices on what we do.\\n00:38:56.400 So when you\\'re in UFC and they close the door, it\\'s kind of [\\xa0__\\xa0] best person wins. You know, you gota it\\'s it\\'s\\n00:39:02.400 survival. When we\\'re in WWE and we both step in the ring and they ring the bell, we\\'re working together, working together\\n00:39:08.000 to put on the best show for the audience. And in that process, you can calculate the risks you want to take.\\n00:39:14.160 And I think that\\'s what allows somebody to be able to perform for 23 years. You\\n00:39:19.920 know, I I don\\'t know. I know that that um age-old stat that everybody says about like the average NFL career is\\n00:39:26.079 what two and a half years or three and a half years. I don\\'t know what the stat is on average UFC career like how long\\n00:39:32.560 when what\\'s your window to be functionally profitable in UFC. But I\\n00:39:37.920 know because our risks are calculated and we\\'re working together rather than against each other. The math is is way\\n00:39:45.200 higher for you to have like a 10, 15, 20 year career in WWE. But that also is 10 more years\\n00:39:53.440 have fallen down, 15 more years have fallen down. So you it\\'s weird like you can choreograph the risk, but you have to do it time and\\n00:40:00.400 time again. And and the schedule in WWE just changed like to do 70 matches a year now in WWE is\\n00:40:07.200 like, man, you you\\'re a workhorse. We used to do 220 230 which is so crazy.\\n00:40:13.599 It\\'s 220 days of trauma in a year cuz you\\'re getting no matter what you\\'re\\n00:40:19.280 getting some trauma. No matter what a guy body slams you, something hap, you\\'re colliding, you go off the ropes,\\n00:40:26.000 you\\'re smashing into each other. I get such a warm feeling when uh first timers go into the ring for the first\\n00:40:31.440 time. It\\'s like, oh, it\\'s like a it\\'s like a bouncy floor and then they fall down once and like the wind\\'s knocked out of\\n00:40:37.760 them. and they\\'re like, \"My brain moved.\" I\\'m like, \"Yeah, yeah, now you got to do that again and again.\" But it\\'s weird. I\\'ve I\\'ve uh I\\'ve gotten to\\n00:40:43.920 work with a lot of standups. And WWE is kind of changing. I I would say it\\'s on the progression of a standup making it\\n00:40:50.560 to just like a stadium tour. But man, when I performed, my sweet spot, we ran\\n00:40:56.880 very parallel lives. Like you I\\'ve worked every city Hampton Beach Casino\\n00:41:01.920 Ballroom to Madison Square Garden like to the Saitama Super Arena to AT&T\\n00:41:07.119 Stadium to Bangor Maine or to Valparezo Indiana. Like you you go to all of these\\n00:41:12.319 places and it\\'s like Friday you\\'re in one place, Saturday you\\'re in another place, Sunday you\\'re in another place, Monday you\\'re in\\n00:41:17.920 another place, Tuesday you\\'re in another place. One day to drop your [\\xa0__\\xa0] one day to catch your flight out, do it again.\\n00:41:23.040 Like it\\'s it\\'s it\\'s kind of we we\\'re kind of like touring standups in that regard. Very similar. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.\\n00:41:28.800 And you\\'re you\\'re responsible for your own trans like and I\\'m speaking from mighty I don\\'t know how it is now cuz I\\n00:41:34.560 got one left and then I\\'m done. But uh you were responsible for your own transportation booking your own hotels like you you were they were just like\\n00:41:41.839 hey we\\'re starting here running here. Good luck. Which is awesome because you create you people are really independent\\n00:41:47.280 when they when they go through that fire and you weed out the people who don\\'t want to be there. Yeah. Because the just the sheer work\\n00:41:53.440 the sheer workload making those clubs and like making doing a tour. It\\'s Also the adrenaline like\\n00:41:58.800 it\\'s like what do you do after a night like that? Most jobs people can\\'t wait to be done and then go home and relax\\n00:42:04.960 and fall asleep where if you\\'re doing standup or obviously wrestling you were\\n00:42:10.079 just you\\'re done late at night and you\\'re like man let the water rush. Yeah. [\\xa0__\\xa0] What can I do better? This [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n00:42:16.400 killed. And then it\\'s 4 in the morning. Yeah. You\\'re buzzing. Yep. You\\'re buzzing. And it\\'s also it\\'s really hard\\n00:42:22.400 to have any kind of a normal relationship because you\\'re just constantly not home. You\\'re constantly\\n00:42:28.160 gone. Like even your friends like you you really as a touring comic, the best\\n00:42:33.359 thing that I ever did is start taking friends with me on the road. Yeah. Instead of just working with like random guys that I didn\\'t know in different\\n00:42:39.599 towns. Those are fun sometimes. Sometimes like you know two out of 10 times you meet a\\n00:42:45.119 new friend. Yeah. Yeah. Eight out of 10 times you\\'re with some annoying alcoholic who, you know, who\\n00:42:51.280 [\\xa0__\\xa0] sucks and and they\\'re annoying and then they want to take you someplace and, you know, you get in trouble.\\n00:42:56.560 Yeah. Yeah. I I mean that that\\'s certainly um the the normal life aspect\\n00:43:02.560 of it. It\\'s also like at full tilt. It\\'s a it\\'s a very absorbing thing. It\\'s a very selfish\\n00:43:08.720 thing. So, I think not only you don\\'t work regular office hours and you\\'re a\\n00:43:14.319 nomad, a gypsy, but especially from a WWE perspective, you you have to like\\n00:43:20.400 you\\'re you\\'re a startup founder. You have to wake up thinking about it. You have to think about it all day. You have\\n00:43:25.920 to go to sleep thinking about it. Wake up in in the two hours of sleep that you get being like, I remember this line or\\n00:43:30.960 maybe we can do this stunt or whatever. Right? And it\\'s people who are in your sphere. At least through my perspective\\n00:43:36.720 and my journey, man, if if you were in my gravity from like 2002 to like 2019,\\n00:43:46.079 I wasn\\'t a part of a team. You did it my way. Like bus leaves at 10. If you\\'re there at 10:01, you\\'re [\\xa0__\\xa0] left.\\n00:43:53.040 Like we\\'re doing this and we\\'re training here and we\\'re doing this and but it\\'s it\\'s so it\\'s so the end product is good.\\n00:43:58.400 So, like the dream job of like, man, I never the the six-year-old kid holding the paper belt can be an adult holding\\n00:44:05.040 the real belt and get shekels for doing that. And I don\\'t ever want to I don\\'t want to put that in jeopardy. So, you\\n00:44:10.400 [\\xa0__\\xa0] are going to have to get in line and we\\'re just going to have to go. Like, it you you know, I I I was absent\\n00:44:16.800 a lot in relationships because if it wasn\\'t on my terms, it didn\\'t exist, you know, because here you got you you\\n00:44:23.280 catch lightning out of a jar. I\\'m a kid from West Newberry who\\'s, you know, come from a family of five and we there\\'s\\n00:44:30.240 always more broke, but man, we were a good level of broke and then now like,\\n00:44:36.160 hey, if you just work hard at this thing, you can kind of not ever be that again. All right, [\\xa0__\\xa0] this. I\\'m doing\\n00:44:41.200 this thing all the time. But that comes with, hey, I\\'m getting married or like\\n00:44:47.359 my grandfather died or I got a birthday coming up or like, hey man, you missed another Thanksgiving. You\\'re damn right\\n00:44:52.720 I did because I\\'m doing the thing. Yeah. You know, so that it\\'s al for me at least it was it was that as well of like\\n00:44:59.280 laser focus all things WWE. Well, it\\'s that in everything that you\\n00:45:04.880 do where you want to really be successful. It takes saying yes to the thing means\\n00:45:10.960 no to everything else. I had Jensen Hang on the podcast the other day who\\'s the CEO of Nvidia and\\n00:45:17.040 like one of the biggest companies on planet Earth. Huge company. [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude still to this day works seven days a\\n00:45:24.319 week. And he was talking about when he goes on vacation, I go, \"Do you go on vacation and just put it all down?\" He\\n00:45:29.359 goes, \"No, I work.\" He goes, \"Even when I\\'m with my family, I have to work. I\\'m working. I work seven days a week. I\\n00:45:35.280 don\\'t take a day off. I love it.\" And he goes, \"And I\\'m terrified of failure.\" He goes, \"That\\'s my motivation. My\\n00:45:41.280 motivation is not I want to succeed. My motivation is fear of failure.\" Yeah.\\n00:45:46.319 Every day I show up saying, \"If I don\\'t do this, we could fail and I\\'m going to work seven days a week.\"\\n00:45:51.839 Everybody thinks they want to be a CEO. You think you want to be a billionaire? Like, you want to do that? You want to\\n00:45:57.359 do that when you\\'re 60 years old? Do you want to be working seven days a week all day long from the moment you wake up? He\\n00:46:02.960 wakes up at 4:30 in the morning. He says he answers thousands of emails a day. I\\'m like, what? How are you? How is that\\n00:46:09.440 even [\\xa0__\\xa0] possible? gets up at 4:30 in the morning, answers all these emails, works all day long, constantly\\n00:46:15.599 problem solving, making AI chips. It\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy, right? Yeah. But that\\'s\\n00:46:21.280 with everything. You want to be at the top of the heap. There\\'s only one way. Yeah. When you see something difficult\\n00:46:27.040 look easy, there\\'s a bunch of 4:30 in the morning wakeups that made that happen.\\n00:46:33.520 You know, I think with everything in life Yeah. anything in life where you really want to excel at it, there\\'s no shortcuts.\\n00:46:39.119 Yeah. doesn\\'t exist. That weeds a lot of people out. It does. It does. And there\\'s a lot of,\\n00:46:44.800 man, armchair quarterback is the easiest and best position on the field. Yeah. I can do that. All I needed to do is do\\n00:46:50.240 this. Sure. Go right ahead. Yeah. Take your best shot. Yeah. Good luck. Yeah. It\\'s It\\'s interesting because it must\\n00:46:56.000 weed out so many talented people. There\\'s probably a lot of talented people that you\\'ve seen over the years that just didn\\'t have that drive to\\n00:47:03.839 constantly improve and succeed and really be thinking about what they\\'re doing all the time. I I like that\\n00:47:08.960 statement because I think the talent is doing it all. You could you could have a\\n00:47:15.599 No, you can have one. You could smoke if you want. I don\\'t care. We have fans in here. Yeah.\\n00:47:20.640 Yeah. With fans suck all the smoke. Okay. I think this the statement of um man so\\n00:47:26.400 many talented people didn\\'t make it. They may have they may be an acrobat. They may be a fast talker, but that\\'s\\n00:47:32.640 not the only attribute that makes one special. Uh, you may be a great joke\\n00:47:37.760 writer, but man, if if you don\\'t master stage presence and you be a joke a great\\n00:47:42.800 joke writer with stage presence, but if you can\\'t lug the tour, yeah, you\\'re not you\\'re not talented for it.\\n00:47:49.520 Well, it\\'s it\\'s really the grind. It is everything the all-encompassing thing. So when someone with great\\n00:47:55.359 athletic ability decides that it\\'s not for them because eventually that is we one thing about WWE um for all the\\n00:48:03.599 arguments of like backstage politico everybody understands the sound of money\\n00:48:10.240 and no one refuses it like I [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate this guy but I got to give him\\n00:48:16.480 another match. It may not be, but I now have to give them a 10-year contract. But when they go out there, if the noise\\n00:48:22.640 is there, even if the they [\\xa0__\\xa0] hate you, you get another match. I\\'m I am\\n00:48:28.559 proof positive of that meritocracy at work. Yeah. Like everybody [\\xa0__\\xa0] hated me. Why\\' they hate you?\\n00:48:34.160 I was just real different. Like I I was just really different. In what way?\\n00:48:39.359 Um so I didn\\'t rock I didn\\'t ruffle any feathers when I kind of uh entered the\\n00:48:46.319 business. kept quiet, did my stuff, but I also didn\\'t connect with the audience and and and I don\\'t know, maybe you guys\\n00:48:52.160 see this in standup or not, but then I got like a personality of like the the white rap guy, like the the white hip-hop guy.\\n00:48:57.760 You know about that? Yeah. But like I [\\xa0__\\xa0] went I [\\xa0__\\xa0] went all in,\\n00:49:03.599 you know, urban gear, like and I\\'m a hip-hop head, so it\\'s like, oh man, this is my sweet spot. This is the the the\\n00:49:09.599 avenue. This isn\\'t all of my personality, but this is one level that I can show that I think everyone will\\n00:49:16.079 get. So, if you go to Madison Square Garden, you get it. But if we go to Wheeling, West Virginia, you\\'ll also get\\n00:49:21.440 it. And you may like it in some places and hate it in some places, but everyone will get it. I will not be selling\\n00:49:26.480 apathy. But in doing that, I never followed dress code. I was\\n00:49:32.240 saying disrespectful [\\xa0__\\xa0] about my peers. Like, I kind of did it my own way. M. So, I was I was kind of ruffling some\\n00:49:39.280 feathers backstage or just I was taking big swings cuz I was going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] get fired anyway. The alternative was\\n00:49:45.200 lose my job. So, I was like, \"Fuck it. I\\'m going down swinging.\" Yeah. And then the people behind the curtain\\n00:49:51.680 were like, \"Ah, the kid\\'s disrespectful to the business. He doesn\\'t care about the business.\" All the while, I just want to keep my [\\xa0__\\xa0] job, you know?\\n00:49:58.079 So the they behind the curtain weren\\'t really invested, but they were also\\n00:50:03.200 humble enough to be like, \"There\\'s noise out there. Got to give them another match and one match at a time. Times 23\\n00:50:11.520 years of compounding interest. We\\'re here.\" What did Vince think about your hip-hop? Hated it and then loved it.\\n00:50:18.480 He hated it and then loved it. And and I think I think I\\'m thinking for somebody, but I think from his perspective is like\\n00:50:26.480 when I hear somebody\\'s idea for a personality, man, I want to be this sports agent guy or whatever. Oh, yo, I\\n00:50:32.319 have I have the idea of what that is in my head. And if their projection of that idea doesn\\'t match my projection that\\n00:50:38.960 idea, I\\'m like, ah, [\\xa0__\\xa0] I hate it. But that doesn\\'t mean it can\\'t work. So, I think what maybe what happened was my\\n00:50:46.960 perspective of the white hip hop guy from the mean street of West Newberry and Vince\\'s perspective of John Cena the\\n00:50:54.480 rapper we probably missed. Like he had an idea and I had an idea and usually he\\n00:51:01.760 will craft it to to his vision. I got to give him respect for allowing me to to kind of to run with it, you know. Well,\\n00:51:08.319 it\\'s probably that fear of fire being fired that like keeps you on the edge. Dude, that was it. Of like uh the Nvidia\\n00:51:15.599 guy of like I don\\'t want to fail. Yeah, I I got the sit down of like, hey, we\\'re going to cut you cuz it\\'s not working. Like you you\\'re\\n00:51:22.319 out there for your matches. You hear the same. It\\'s not working. And I there\\'s no argument there. I\\'m like [\\xa0__\\xa0] all\\n00:51:28.720 right. I got to touch the sun. I got to make it. I got to play for the Yankees. I got my one at bat. I\\'m Moonlight Graham. And then they heard me rap in\\n00:51:35.760 the back of the bus and was like, \"Man, Stephanie heard me rap in the back of the bus.\" Yeah. And was like, \"Yo, you want to do that\\n00:51:41.440 on TV?\" I\\'m like, \"Lose my job or [\\xa0__\\xa0] rap?\" \"Yeah, let\\'s go. Let\\'s Let\\'s do this.\"\\n00:51:46.640 Yeah. So, it was Stephanie\\'s idea. And it was a [\\xa0__\\xa0] accident, dude. It was an accident. It\\'s my final my final\\n00:51:52.160 overseas tour for the WWE. And the boys just spend time. Like, that\\'s the one time they get the whole\\n00:51:57.920 group together is overseas because you don\\'t want to be hurting cats like in Amsterdam or something. Everybody rides on the bus. You go from town to town. So\\n00:52:04.880 like to pass the time, the boys just do whatever. And they were freestyling in the back of the bus. And I normally just\\n00:52:10.319 [\\xa0__\\xa0] kept to myself because I was raised in the environment of like keep your ears open, keep your mouth shut,\\n00:52:16.559 don\\'t do anything unless spoken to. So I I did that, but I didn\\'t I also didn\\'t make any connections with people who\\n00:52:21.680 were putting their lives on the line for me. You know, some of the guys you you really beat the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of in the rings\\n00:52:27.680 are like your best friends. Uh, so I didn\\'t have any of those connections and I heard these guys rapping. I just\\n00:52:33.599 remember playing Roller Coaster Tycoon on my laptop, fold that [\\xa0__\\xa0] up, putting it away and be like, I\\'m going to the\\n00:52:38.960 back of the bus and just waited my turn and then filleted like 12 guys.\\n00:52:44.160 Yeah. And Stephanie was like, \"How the [\\xa0__\\xa0] did you remember all that?\" I\\'m like, \"No, no, it\\'s freestyle. You just make it up.\" And she\\'s like, \"Well, make up\\n00:52:50.880 something about me.\" And we were boarding a plane. And I literally like utilized the plane, the people getting\\n00:52:56.240 on the plane, what she was wearing, what she was eating. She\\'s like, \"Would you do this on TV?\" And that\\'s where we got a chance.\\n00:53:02.800 Wow. That\\'s It wasn\\'t like off to the moon. Like, I got a a shitty chance on a small spot\\n00:53:10.160 and that worked. So then I got moved to like the dog [\\xa0__\\xa0] Saturday night program that nobody\\n00:53:16.079 watches. But the cool thing is no one\\'s watching. So like I could do whatever I wanted. So, I started saying more racy\\n00:53:22.319 [\\xa0__\\xa0] and dressing more outlandish and having more personality and like claiming ownership of the show. I call\\n00:53:28.240 myself Mr. Saturday Night and it\\'s the shitty show. You don\\'t want to be Mr. Saturday Night, but I did\\n00:53:33.359 and then I got another match and got another match and one by one it kind of brought me here.\\n00:53:38.720 Wow. Just a [\\xa0__\\xa0] happy accident, man. That\\'s crazy. All the way to\\n00:53:44.079 even when the bells were like, \"Hey, you want the whole thing\\'s a [\\xa0__\\xa0] accident. You want to start training? [\\xa0__\\xa0] yeah, sure.\" All right, great. And\\n00:53:51.760 you want to start rapping? Yeah, [\\xa0__\\xa0] it. Sure. Let\\'s see what happens. That\\'s amazing. It\\'s a happy accident. And for it to go all the way to last\\n00:53:58.400 year\\'s massive heel turn. He went heel, dude. And I\\n00:54:03.920 That was this year, by the way. Yeah. Yeah, that was this year. Yeah, it\\'s been a it\\'s crazy year.\\n00:54:10.079 Yeah, that was I was at Mania and man, one literally perhaps I other than maybe\\n00:54:17.760 Hogan, right? The greatest heel turn in wrestling history when a good good good\\n00:54:23.520 good crowd-pleasing guy goes bad bad and dark. You had moments the things you\\n00:54:30.160 were saying, the way you were saying them. Epic, iconic, iconic heel turn.\\n00:54:36.079 Cold, dark, working with the rock. He was in cahoots. That\\'s the good guy, Cody.\\n00:54:41.119 You can like see the people\\'s faces. That That\\'s the fun thing. It\\'s like uh the stuff is so simple, but it\\'s it\\'s\\n00:54:47.440 the if you take out the crowd in that situation and just put those three guys, it is really [\\xa0__\\xa0] up what we do. But\\n00:54:53.520 when you add the audience in the back and all of their faces and what\\'s going on, that\\'s what makes Bro, even your face, you you you got\\n00:54:59.280 like a mean guy face all of a sudden. It\\'s like you look like a different person. That\\'s interesting. I was having a bad day.\\n00:55:07.200 Well, this is also when you\\'d already done a bunch of acting. Uh, yes. Like this is this year.\\n00:55:12.240 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. This is uh February this year. Yeah. How much of the creative control do you\\n00:55:19.599 have over the aspects of that heel turn? Like for example, one thing that I\\n00:55:26.400 thought was the coolest, I was I was in the front row of WrestleMania behind the\\n00:55:32.400 Spanish announce table. So I\\'m directly across from the entrance, you know, the\\n00:55:37.440 giant Wrestleman is a football stadium in Las Vegas and there was no music and\\n00:55:42.880 it was a black background. Normally he\\'s the most color with the most iconic\\n00:55:48.319 loud wild music. No music, black background, and in white letters it just\\n00:55:53.520 said Cena. And you just walked out with\\n00:55:58.640 literally the statement was I\\'m not here to entertain you people basically is what it felt like. And I loved it. I\\n00:56:06.319 mean, this is the main event of Mania. You are so entertained. I mean, I want to entertain you. [\\xa0__\\xa0] I [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. Yeah, I have a I\\'m a I have a the degree\\n00:56:14.400 in pro wrestling, but my masters is in healom. Like it\\'s like the bad I just\\n00:56:20.640 love a bad guy. And even ever since that bad guy turn I feel like and I feel like\\n00:56:27.520 most bad guy fans do now newly connected with the back to the return of the good\\n00:56:32.799 guy scene. Yeah. There it is. Oh, I mean it\\'s it was literally just I used to come out like a Tasmanian\\n00:56:38.880 devil and then just just reversed it all. And it seems like nothing but it\\'s\\n00:56:44.559 iconic. just cold as ice. Everyone else for four hours coming out with colorful music and\\n00:56:51.440 pyro and all this stuff. And there\\'s the guy that normally did it the best and the biggest just really not giving a\\n00:56:59.040 [\\xa0__\\xa0] And Wrestlemania, if you\\'re going to do it, like you you\\'d give your best entrance for Wrestlemania. And this was\\n00:57:05.839 I guess we were going for the shittiest one. Oh, but it but it just rang the opposite\\n00:57:10.960 and simple and true. The Octagon isn\\'t just in Las Vegas anymore.

So like for example those things those details that\\'s you\\n00:58:36.160 mostly pitching to the creative team like like for example like the even just the white letters the black entrance is\\n00:58:42.880 that how does that kind of come together? So I think that\\'s um I and I\\'ve been\\n00:58:48.799 lucky enough to kind of take this perspective of not knowing everything and realizing that even even with 23\\n00:58:55.760 years of fluency I\\'m not the smartest guy in the room. I don\\'t know the technology they have and what they can\\n00:59:01.280 do. Now granted, a black LED board, I I could probably come up with that, but what I what I\\'d like to do is lean on my\\n00:59:08.559 resources. Like, hey, let\\'s go to production and see what production is thinking. And I I don\\'t want to tell\\n00:59:14.960 them what to do because I want to hear their ideas first. Yeah. And production was like, what if we just\\n00:59:20.559 went basic? I\\'m like, how basic can you go? Yeah. What if we just blacked everything out? Yeah. But I know from what you guys have\\n00:59:26.880 said, you also like to light the No. No. What if we just black everything out? You guys would do that. Oh, that sucks.\\n00:59:32.400 Yeah, let\\'s do that. Yeah. So, it\\'s not it\\'s not me with all of these things. I don\\'t I don\\'t have\\n00:59:38.079 enough depth of field to touch all the bases, but I will go to every department. Yeah. And say like, okay, entrance is a big\\n00:59:45.440 part of what we do. What do we do for lighting? What do we do for production? Go to camera. Like, how do you guys want\\n00:59:50.640 to shoot it? And then it trickles down when you talk to the talent you\\'re working with. How do we portray this\\n00:59:56.079 message? Uh and then of course it starts at the top with creatively, I want to make you a bad guy, so we\\'re going to do\\n01:00:02.400 that. Okay, sure. We\\'re going to do that. How do you want to do that? But it\\'s I think it\\'s getting we have a lot\\n01:00:07.520 of talented people and just allowing them to do their job and and let you know like, oh, I was kind of thinking this and then tell them, yeah, that\\'s a\\n01:00:14.000 good idea. Let\\'s do that. Yeah. You know, it\\'s amazing because I don\\'t know what I don\\'t know what I miss if I\\'m making all the\\n01:00:19.359 demands. To show you the contrast, his opponent that night came out to I think it was 40\\n01:00:24.640 people on red, white, and blue dirt bikes all dressed like American people.\\n01:00:30.240 He comes out elevated from inside of the stage wearing this super goddy mask that he\\n01:00:35.440 has to take off. Fireworks, fireworks, fire, sparks, smoke, all of these different things. And he just comes out\\n01:00:42.000 blankfaced. I just got my bunk sock on the back. Just run on. There you go.\\n01:00:47.440 It\\'s so funny hearing Tony talk about this because for people who don\\'t know, the way Tony runs Kill Tony is basically\\n01:00:56.160 a version of a WWE event. I mean, it really is like when he does the arena\\n01:01:02.559 shows, he\\'s has everything set up like a WWE event. Yeah. I mean, even the thing we did with\\n01:01:08.319 Shane when when Shane was playing when Shane was playing Trump when Trump and I were supposedly feuding online, Trump\\n01:01:15.200 had said something about me online and then uh Trump\\'s talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] like as Shane\\'s talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] and then the music\\n01:01:20.720 plays and I show up behind him. It\\'s pure pro wrestling. Oh yeah, it\\'s pure pro wrestling. And MSG\\'s on their feet shocked. You\\n01:01:27.359 know, you\\'re surprising this crowd that thinks they\\'re just there for a comedy show and well there\\'s the panel. I guess\\n01:01:32.880 that\\'s what we\\'re going to have tonight. But the surprises, the ups, the downs.\\n01:01:38.240 And then he brings up Joey Diaz. So it\\'s like boom boom. Kind of like that big\\n01:01:43.359 finish at Mania that I was talking about like superstar bringing up a superstar, you know, music, music, smoke, fire.\\n01:01:50.559 Yes. All these little things. The more the more you make it important, the more important it becomes. Yeah. As when what he\\'s saying is like\\n01:01:57.440 when Trump was there, this was as Trump was running for president and Trump thought that I was endorsing RFK. So he got mad at me. So I said I am here to\\n01:02:04.079 endorse someone and I brought out Joey Diaz. I mean which is great because you\\'re going to\\n01:02:09.359 get a reveal but you get a different reveal and it\\'s like and everybody went nuts and but it\\'s like the audience they are into it like\\n01:02:15.760 they\\'re into pro wrestling. They want all the heel turns. They want all the chaos. They want all the the the\\n01:02:21.680 pageantry and the the fire and the explosions and all the [\\xa0__\\xa0] Man, you get you get any live audience,\\n01:02:28.079 they\\'re into all that. Like watch a college football game, watch a soccer game overseas or or football as they\\n01:02:34.000 would say. Like the fans, it\\'s it\\'s like a group think of energy. Mhm. That\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] nuts.\\n01:02:41.119 Like audiences want it. It doesn\\'t matter where you\\'re at. Like what man, when comics just go out and light\\n01:02:47.040 up a stage and they have that [\\xa0__\\xa0] stage presence and they just slay a set, the [\\xa0__\\xa0] audience is rolling in the\\n01:02:52.400 aisles. like they you you let the you let them in and they they can help make\\n01:02:58.000 a joke that might not hit the night before. Slay like it\\'s it\\'s all about the moment. It\\'s all about being there\\n01:03:03.760 and and reading the people. And the the fun thing about WWE is you can you can\\n01:03:08.880 go out there with an idea and and kind I can only imagine this as kind of like standup where if you got your set and\\n01:03:14.240 you tell the first joke to crickets, you may try another joke and if that\\'s crickets, you got to [\\xa0__\\xa0] pivot.\\n01:03:19.599 Yeah. So, we go out, we go out and do something and oh man, they\\'re into it. Great. All\\n01:03:25.520 right, we have them. We just got to maintain their attention until we get to act three essentially.\\n01:03:31.440 But if you hear [\\xa0__\\xa0] crickets, you\\'re like, \"All right, we\\'re switching it up. [\\xa0__\\xa0] pivot right now.\"\\n01:03:36.480 And you That\\'s the beauty. That\\'s That\\'s one of the things that I love the most is the It\\'s not just me and the other person\\n01:03:43.039 out there. Like the audience is the act every like that moment only means something. If you put a blue screen\\n01:03:49.520 behind the people, it is super [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. Like, what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are they doing and why does that mean anything,\\n01:03:54.559 right? But when you let the level of the audience and everybody\\'s on their feet and they go, \"No.\" Like,\\n01:03:59.599 it\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] everything. It\\'s everything. That\\'s why Tonyy\\'s so interested in the coordination of it all and the setting\\n01:04:05.359 and the sabotage and all the chaos that\\'s involved in all of it. But these are these are human emotions\\n01:04:10.880 that are universal. Mhm. Everyone understands betrayal, jealousy, anger, disappointment, failure,\\n01:04:17.119 excitement. Like these are universal things that you don\\'t if we don\\'t speak the same\\n01:04:22.480 language, you still have felt these things. And you could watch that. No one spoke in that clip. But you could watch\\n01:04:29.119 that in anywhere in the world and be like, \"That kid just got [\\xa0__\\xa0] over, right? Oh, what what\\'s going to happen next?\"\\n01:04:35.280 Like that\\'s the beautiful appeal of it, you know? It\\'s it\\'s we don\\'t hit too far above our weight class. Like we we try\\n01:04:41.680 to send largecale universal messages based on true real human emotion that we\\n01:04:47.119 all know. Yeah. And up to that day, that moment, like even that thing that we were just\\n01:04:52.400 telling you about me bringing uh him coming out, that being a reveal, him\\n01:04:57.440 bringing up Diaz was coordinated literally I think 15 minutes before go\\n01:05:03.920 time. like literally me with a with a big piece of paper going, \"Hey Joe, what\\n01:05:09.520 if we did this?\" He confirms it. So I go to hair and makeup where they\\'re finishing up Shane as Trump, which in\\n01:05:16.240 itself is just hysterical. I pitch it to him. He loves it. I go to Diaz, I say\\n01:05:21.680 Rogan\\'s going to bring you up and and the thing happens quick. Whereas with you know every form of entertainment\\n01:05:27.760 that we\\'re used to other than wrestling and like kind of you know Kill Tony in\\n01:05:35.119 this instance everything\\'s so pre-planned that if we over pre-planned it we wouldn\\'t have had the topical RFK\\n01:05:42.720 endorsement because it was like news that day. Sure. And uh so again that\\n01:05:47.760 inspiration you know totally comes from there because what else is doing that at MSG 10 minutes before the show\\n01:05:55.440 reorganizing things. So now we have to go to production and go have Rogan\\'s\\n01:06:00.880 uh LED ready and then Diaz in that order. You know\\n01:06:06.240 it literally comes from that and when it goes right there\\'s not a better feeling in the world. Exactly. I just get to sit back and\\n01:06:11.839 watch. Yeah. But it\\'s so funny that that connection with pro wrestling is really\\n01:06:17.200 why you\\'ve made Kill Tony the way it is. Yeah. Like without your love of pro wrestling,\\n01:06:23.680 it would be such a different show. Like if it was just run like a traditional standup show, right,\\n01:06:28.720 it\\'s there\\'s so much else going on that makes it the biggest show. Yeah. Well, it\\'s long-term storytelling.\\n01:06:35.520 We had a guy on on Monday that had been doing it 14 years and man, he just his\\n01:06:41.839 timing was off. He struggled even after the minute. I go, \"You\\'ve been doing it 14 years.\" He goes, \"Yeah, man.\" I go,\\n01:06:47.599 \"What do you how do you make money?\" He goes, \"I do this.\" I go, \"You do this for a living.\" He goes, \"Yeah.\" I go,\\n01:06:54.720 \"You must have better material. I\\'m going to give you another shot. Do another minute. Here we go, ladies and\\n01:07:00.640 gentlemen.\" And I introduce him again. And he bombs again. And literally um I\\n01:07:06.559 was talking with it about it with Stephanie after the show because she just happened to be at Kil Tony on\\n01:07:12.319 Monday and she goes a guy like that you know what h you know what happens next I\\n01:07:17.440 go hopefully hopefully the guy gets pulled out of the bucket in a month or two has a great set puts it together\\n01:07:24.799 realizes oh his timing was off he wasn\\'t taking a breath he wasn\\'t connecting with the crowd he was just memorizing\\n01:07:31.200 his stuff and it the story begins to be told about this guy. And sometimes it\\n01:07:36.960 happens in reverse. Sometimes somebody starts off, you know, fire hot, rocket strap to the back.\\n01:07:42.960 Yep. And then that\\'s kind of the sadder thing, right? Is starting hot and then\\n01:07:48.799 never being able to touch that again. Have a moment like your first time. Well, it\\'s like we were talking about people with talent. We all know someone\\n01:07:55.440 who killed during open mic days that we were like, \"Wow, this guy\\'s going to be huge.\" They have like undeniable talent\\n01:08:01.599 and they just can\\'t manage it. They can\\'t figure it out. They self-sabotage.\\n01:08:06.720 They get addicted to drugs or alcohol or whatever it is. There are so many things. Yeah. It\\'s not just the ability to go out and\\n01:08:13.440 do the task. Well, there\\'s so many variables that will [\\xa0__\\xa0] you up. Yeah. Dude,\\n01:08:19.040 you\\'re right. So many so many gifted people have just just\\n01:08:24.719 have that roadblock in front of them. Which is why I think conversations with successful people are so important\\n01:08:30.479 because you get to hear those stories. You get to hear like with Jensen the other day, he was talking about how Nvidia was basically bankrupt. They were\\n01:08:36.880 they were on their way out and someone gave them a chance. Like some some one guy that was an investor gave him a\\n01:08:42.799 chance and then they wound up becoming successful. And then there was this these moments and people need to know\\n01:08:50.479 that you\\'re going to have those hurdles there. You\\'re going to have those roadblocks. You\\'re going to have to figure out how to adjust. It\\'s not easy.\\n01:08:58.238 None of no one who\\'s been successful at anything will tell you the whole ride was easy.\\n01:09:03.679 Yeah. But a lot of the times sometime man sometimes we\\'ll be in it. I\\n01:09:08.799 So I\\'ve been through like three generations of knowledge and learning uh\\n01:09:13.920 23 years in in the business at operating at a high level. I have seen thousands\\n01:09:20.000 and like it is the man if you\\'re a stud in peewee football league then you go to\\n01:09:25.120 this junior high school and then you\\'re the number one player in college and then you\\'re the number one number one\\n01:09:30.158 player high school number one player in college eke out a spot in the NFL and then a\\n01:09:35.198 year later you\\'re gone because the funnel just gets so thin like WWE has like 200 personnel in their\\n01:09:42.560 NXT development program right now maybe 10 will make Maybe. And of those 10, like really\\n01:09:49.920 honestly, maybe one will make it. And what the hope is is over a six-year\\n01:09:56.239 period of those classes of 200 that get metriculated probably every four months,\\n01:10:02.239 so we\\'re talking 6,000 people. I\\'m I\\'m hoping one makes it. Wow. in in five or six years, I need one\\n01:10:09.920 because my top guy right now, my Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodess and and the Charlotte Flair and Becky Lynches of the\\n01:10:16.159 world, like um they\\'ll they\\'ll last half a decade to draw. Maybe if if we\\'re\\n01:10:21.280 lucky, maybe we\\'ll we\\'ll get it more. They can, you know, maybe parlay it into a decade or two, but that\\'s an anomaly.\\n01:10:27.440 You got to play the the legit math of like after five years, I better have somebody in the on deck circle. M.\\n01:10:33.040 So, out of like 5 6,000, I just need one. But it\\'s still everybody\\'s biting\\n01:10:38.880 their fingernails of like we don\\'t have the person yet. It\\'s so many folks just don\\'t make it. Just don\\'t make it.\\n01:10:46.080 Yeah. That\\'s that\\'s the parallel to standup. Yeah. It\\'s man, so that you know, there\\'s so many people\\n01:10:51.840 that we we were talking last night in the green room. Thousands. And when I see them like in the ring do stuff, I\\'m like, I could\\n01:10:57.920 never do that. But they just won\\'t they just don\\'t make it. It\\'s just there\\'s so many things that [\\xa0__\\xa0] people up. So much\\n01:11:04.719 self- sabotage. So much inability to to stay the course in our own worst enemy.\\n01:11:10.719 You know, I don\\'t know. Yeah. I don\\'t know. Yeah. Yeah. Happy accidents, though.\\n01:11:16.239 [\\xa0__\\xa0] it. Well, yeah. Happy accidents. But not just that. It\\'s you being able to stay\\n01:11:21.679 on course and you being able to recognize that, you know, okay, this didn\\'t work. What do I do? You want me\\n01:11:28.000 to rap? Okay, I\\'ll [\\xa0__\\xa0] rap. Like a lot of people would have been like, \"I\\'m not [\\xa0__\\xa0] rapping.\\n01:11:33.360 That\\'s beneath me. I\\'m here to be a wrestler. I\\'m not a gimmick. I\\'m not going to be a buffoon.\"\\n01:11:38.480 Yeah. I\\'ll be a buffoon cuz it beats working a real job. It\\'s not only that. It\\'s part of the\\n01:11:43.920 entertainment of it all. Even the cringe aspect of it where people are like, \"What is going on here?\" Like, it\\'s\\n01:11:50.960 great. He loves that [\\xa0__\\xa0] Oh, it\\'s the best. The best. You know who my guy is right now? Dominic\\n01:11:57.199 Mysterio. Love Dom. Oh my god. So he\\'s Were you?\\n01:12:02.320 Uh, no. You\\'re here. I was going to You weren\\'t at Petco, were you? No. Ah gosh, we had fun over there. I bet I was. I I caught a lot of it.\\n01:12:09.600 Yeah, man. That kid\\'s good, too. Like good good human being. I happen to be in um Salt Lake City\\n01:12:15.199 doing a gig. I was doing standup in one arena and the WWE happened to be in the\\n01:12:21.440 other arena in Salt Lake City just a few weeks ago. And I\\'m like, \"Ah, darn.\" But I look it up and it\\'s a 5:00 pm taping\\n01:12:28.800 of WWE. So I hit up my friends at WWE. I go, I\\'m coming in. I\\'m bringing my openers, right? Uh anyway, Dominic\\n01:12:37.440 Mysterio is in a triple threat match and his whole thing is he\\'s wrestling royalties. He\\'s Rey Mysterio\\'s son, but\\n01:12:44.640 he claims that he might be Eddie Guerrero\\'s son because he because his father\\'s, you know, one of the ultimate\\n01:12:49.840 good guys of all time. So basically he takes on uh the the the\\n01:12:56.880 traits of Eddie Guerrero whose whole thing was cheating and lying and stealing, breaking the rules in original\\n01:13:03.840 ways all the time. And he\\'s doing a triple threat match which means there\\'s three guys at once, right? But if the if\\n01:13:12.159 someone beats anybody, you could lose your belt. And his Intercontinental Champion, I think it\\'s Intercontinental,\\n01:13:17.760 right? is on the line and he gets thrown outside the ring and I\\'m having fun,\\n01:13:22.880 right? I go, \"Dominic, cheat. Do something.\" Right? And he\\'s kind of on the other side of the thing and he lifts\\n01:13:28.480 up his head and looks at me and goes like that. He gives a big wink and then he goes back down again and I\\'m cracking\\n01:13:34.640 up. I go, \"Did you see that?\" I\\'m next to Paulie Shore. I go, \"Did you just see him wink?\" He goes, \"Yeah, man. What\\'s he going to do, bro?\" I don\\'t know. But\\n01:13:41.840 these two guys in the ring are wrestling and one of them has the other one in a submission hold a camel clutch. I can\\'t\\n01:13:48.159 remember who it was but anyway. And I\\'m like you I literally even me watching\\n01:13:53.920 since I was a kid and even though he just winked at me it was just enough time I forgot that Dominic was over\\n01:14:00.640 there cuz this action in the ring is really happening. Something\\'s about to happen and you hear the bell ring and I\\n01:14:06.800 look over and there\\'s Dominic with the hammer in his hand ringing the bell and the guy lets go with a submission and\\n01:14:13.360 the referee goes, \"What the hell?\" And something I hadn\\'t seen in 35 years of\\n01:14:20.159 watching this thing. He was He\\'s innovative enough to find a brand new\\n01:14:26.080 way to cheat in this twice. A brand new way to cheat. and the crowd,\\n01:14:32.640 everybody\\'s cracking up. It\\'s a whole new right when you think you\\'ve seen it\\n01:14:37.920 all. This guy who you would love, he\\'s literally like built like me. He flexes\\n01:14:42.960 like Nate Diaz without flexing and he\\'s just braggadocious.\\n01:14:48.400 Oh yeah. He thinks, see, he thinks he won, but the ref\\'s like, \"No.\" And hold\\n01:14:54.480 on, they got to cut to Dominic. He just loves it.\\n01:15:01.600 Yep. There\\'s our guy. Dirty Dom.\\n01:15:07.520 Yeah. And the crowd just loves him. That\\'s all\\n01:15:13.360 of us right there. That\\'s Matty Edgar, Joe D. Rosa, Paulie Shore, me. It was D.\\n01:15:18.719 Roza\\'s first real wrestling event. He had the time of his life. Childlike wonder. I I love getting people in there live\\n01:15:24.880 for the first time. Yes. There\\'s something funny about a pro wrestler that\\'s not built to Oh. Oh yeah. And he\\'s the champ. And all\\n01:15:31.840 all these other guys. That guy pent. Man, he just whipped my ass. Dirty dump. He just whipped my ass. Yeah,\\n01:15:37.280 for real. I just lost the Intercontinental Championship to that son of a [\\xa0__\\xa0] Look at him. Covered in gold.\\n01:15:42.640 Yeah. Probably what 5\\'9. No, he\\'s a tall drink of water. He\\'s\\n01:15:47.760 taller than me, but he\\'s 170 lbs. Soaking wet. Yeah, exactly. Such a uniquely American\\n01:15:53.280 form of art. Yeah, it really is. It\\'s weird because um in pockets of the world like it\\'s uh Japan\\n01:16:00.320 has their own style of doing it. Um Latin America has their own style of doing it. The UK has their own style of doing it. But this\\n01:16:06.880 Yeah. Like the Japanese is very strong style with respect to martial art. Um the\\n01:16:12.400 English style is very like catches catch can, a real like technical expose. The Latin American style, the Mexican style\\n01:16:18.800 is high-flying. Mhm. The the American offering of like steak,\\n01:16:25.040 sizzle, apple pie, ice cream, Fourth of July, everything like huge. And that\\'s all Vince, right?\\n01:16:32.320 A lot of it. So, is it all ever one person? Right. It\\'s not. A lot of it is. A lot of it is. But like\\n01:16:39.040 uh promotions like World Class Championship Wrestling were were some of the first to use music. Vince was the first to be like, \"Rock\\n01:16:45.280 and roll. Get over here and get on cable and let\\'s let\\'s blow this thing out. I want to do it. It\\'s It\\'s not just\\n01:16:51.600 something we have in a local VFW with cigar smoke and guys taking side action\\n01:16:56.960 on carnival tricks. No, this is a [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing and we are going to make this a [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing.\\n01:17:02.560 Yeah. You know, it\\'s also a [\\xa0__\\xa0] thing where it\\'s a lot of it is not televised cuz you\\'re\\n01:17:08.719 just traveling around the country doing these shows. Yeah. So that that the business model has kind of changed where media content\\n01:17:16.080 is king now. So uh from what I understand from TKO and I know their\\n01:17:21.600 executives will correct me but from my perspective we have scaled back on the live event only uh offerings which helps\\n01:17:29.760 you know uh lick the wounds. It\\'s weird it like you don\\'t bump enough or you don\\'t bump as much but you kind of need\\n01:17:36.000 to get in there and bump to get your callous and to get your wind and timing. So it\\'s it\\'s kind of you get your signals crossed. But anyhow, um the\\n01:17:43.280 content that is provided is always available for media or or 99% where it\\n01:17:48.800 used to be the opposite. We used to do like four live shows, one TV taping. So you\\'d have four live shows under your\\n01:17:56.800 match, you know, you do you do like um Lafayette, Little Rock, Pensacola, and\\n01:18:02.400 then TV in Orlando, you know, and that would be the end of the run. And then you\\'d do it again of like Bangor,\\n01:18:08.880 Portsmith, um, Providence, TV in Boston, you know, like, and then you\\'d go for another week\\n01:18:15.120 and go somewhere else. But it\\'s it\\'s different now. It\\'s like every piece is televised for the media, which is great\\n01:18:21.280 because we get a lot out to our fans across the world, but like I learned I learned how to fail in those\\n01:18:26.560 non-televised events. M I could take big swings cuz it\\'s like, man, if I\\'m on the the middle of a card\\n01:18:32.880 in in Valareerezo and I kind of [\\xa0__\\xa0] up in a gymnasium with 3,500 people, they\\n01:18:39.199 might they might tell me to [\\xa0__\\xa0] off, but there\\'s also the last match that\\'s going to send them home happy. So, let\\'s\\n01:18:44.239 try this new weird thing. And that\\'s where like me being invisible starts, you know? It\\'s just like, ah, [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n01:18:50.960 try it. Who cares? Because it\\'s it\\'s an environment where you don\\'t want to fail. Now it\\'s we there\\'s way more\\n01:18:57.040 advantage on getting our content out there, but production is super slick. It\\'s like really precise. It everyone\\'s\\n01:19:05.199 really good. And um I don\\'t know how many people go out there and just like like Dom. Like that was an example of\\n01:19:11.040 swinging big. I\\'m going to fake ring the bell, right? Will people even get that? Who cares?\\n01:19:16.800 Let\\'s try it. like he\\'s he\\'s the only one of those guys who will or very few of those guys will stand on an idea like\\n01:19:23.040 that where the other guys are like no I want to have a good choreographed performance because I want my stuff to look good\\n01:19:28.400 because it\\'s on television and going around the world you know I loved the non-televised events but there\\'s just there\\'s not\\n01:19:34.880 there\\'s not it\\'s not a good business model the so how does a young person coming up now\\n01:19:40.080 learn how to fail that is I think a conundrum that we\\'re facing um because you you\\'re failing in\\n01:19:47.199 front of the world, right? You know, um it\\'s it\\'s weird. You can have\\n01:19:52.239 you can it\\'s like you work out your set, but you can\\'t do it on small clubs before you go to an arena.\\n01:19:57.760 It\\'s like you would you would work out your set at home and then you just play the in it dome or you play Barclay\\n01:20:04.640 Center. Like you don\\'t have a small room to be like, \"All right, it landed. Oh man, I got to\\n01:20:10.719 [\\xa0__\\xa0] rework that one.\" You don\\'t ever have that. You just have this. You put it together in your head. Do you think it\\'s okay? And then you\\'re out there.\\n01:20:17.520 So, I I I don\\'t know. Um I\\'m not saying it can\\'t work. I think it can because analytics show that it it does work and\\n01:20:24.320 we we have a lot of people watching now. But from my perspective, I really enjoyed the carefree nature of just\\n01:20:31.760 going out and being ready for anything and and it being okay if I I [\\xa0__\\xa0] up\\n01:20:37.920 and I failed. If I told some bad jokes, I could come back and be like, \"That didn\\'t work. That didn\\'t work.\" And then\\n01:20:43.840 you have a partner to be like, \"Oh, and this didn\\'t work, but this slayed. Why don\\'t you do this again?\" Like,\\n01:20:49.520 literally, that\\'s where this came from. Just [\\xa0__\\xa0] around at live events. And, \"Oh my god, there\\'s noise. I\\'ll do it tomorrow night. We\\'re in a different\\n01:20:55.440 town. Let\\'s see if they get How did you come up with that?\" It was a dare. My brother a happy [\\xa0__\\xa0] accident. My brother dared me to\\n01:21:01.280 do it. Like, when we um when I was in the middle of the the rapping wormhole,\\n01:21:07.040 I made I I\\'m a platinum rapper. I made my own album. So, like in in making\\n01:21:14.400 Yes, this is amazing. Drink it in. Drink it in. Uh, in uh in making the album, we would bring home\\n01:21:21.040 all the tracks and like my little brother was our test audience and he would do this dance where he would like\\n01:21:26.560 shake his head and keep his hand in front of him like that is man, look at you. He\\'s like, you won\\'t do that on TV. And again, I was on the programs that no\\n01:21:34.480 one was watching. So, it\\'s like no one\\'s watching anyway. Yeah, [\\xa0__\\xa0] you. I will do it on TV. And I did it on some\\n01:21:42.400 meaningless Saturday show and there was a little bit of noise. So I took it with me on the road for the next week and did\\n01:21:47.679 it on the live events that weren\\'t televised. There\\'s a little bit of noise. Okay. Like this is my thing now.\\n01:21:52.960 This is my thing. And I just You can\\'t see me. And like that\\'s now it\\'s a thing.\\n01:21:59.360 Yeah. Amazing. Yeah. So it\\'s I did it on a dare. Wow. But like I also had I was in a\\n01:22:06.000 place to be able to tell my brother, \"Okay, I can waste two seconds on an inside joke between you and I.\" That\\'s\\n01:22:12.800 the dare. It\\'s not going to ruin the match, but if you\\'re watching, if you\\'re the only one person watching Velocity\\n01:22:18.080 that night, you\\'ll be like, \"Inside joke. Got it. All right. It\\'s like shouting out your gaming group.\" Like\\n01:22:24.400 seven people get the joke, but this is one of those things where it kind of fit and it stuck. Wow. It\\'s just so many of those things\\n01:22:31.679 in your life. so many of those like fortuitous moments. Well, I you know um admittedly I I have\\n01:22:39.600 a I have an optimism bias. I I I will admit that. But life will will deal\\n01:22:46.239 opportunity. It\\'s a it\\'s it\\'s a matter of understanding that it\\'s happening. You know, don\\'t get in your\\n01:22:53.120 own way. Yeah. Like say, \"Yeah, come here. Sit with you guys. This is a new experience for me.\"\\n01:22:58.880 Uh like, \"Yeah, let\\'s do it.\" Okay, great. Um, man, first wrestler to ever\\n01:23:05.440 retire. Yes, that\\'s a good idea. We\\'re just gonna do it. Yeah, but you\\'ll never be able to come back. Yes, but the let\\'s just do this thing. Like, life is\\n01:23:11.920 throwing me an opportunity to create a year\\'s worth of programming narrative that I think will be interesting. The\\n01:23:17.520 alternative is to do what everybody else has done and maybe hang on too long and people like, man, you should have left a few years ago. Now, let\\'s let\\'s let\\'s do\\n01:23:23.760 this rap. Let\\'s do this. Do you want to train? It involves you working at this shitty job where you\\'re probably gonna I\\n01:23:30.239 tried to be a cop and failed. I was going to go down and join the Marines. That\\'s lifelong employment. I\\'m I\\'m\\n01:23:35.440 really good with structure. I dig uniform. Like I give me what to do and like a a code of conduct to live by. I\\n01:23:42.239 have a feeling I would have fit in there great. I love being in shape. They they feed you over there. Like I I think I\\n01:23:47.679 would have done okay. But life put an opportunity in front of me and I was stupid enough to say yes. Going out\\n01:23:54.000 naked in the Oscars. I was just on Jimmy Kimmel last night. He\\'s like, \"Man, you want to do this bit?\" I\\'m like, \"Dude, I am super tired. I\\'m on I\\'m on a\\n01:24:01.920 different coast.\" He\\'s like, \"Let me send you the bit.\" And I read it. I\\'m like, \"Yo, [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n01:24:08.400 All right. I\\'m going to do it.\" What\\'d you do? I shuffled out there with an index card over my dick. Oh, that that thing. Yeah, that\\'s\\n01:24:15.840 But like, man, in a room full of not even peers or contemporaries, like the\\n01:24:21.920 pantheon of the professional goal that you try to reach. I don\\'t know any of these [\\xa0__\\xa0] people. I don\\'t belong in\\n01:24:27.120 that room. Right? And he\\'s like, \"Yeah, man. Just kind of walk out there naked. It\\'ll be a fun bit.\" And he\\'s right. It would be a funny bit, but I could have got in my\\n01:24:33.520 own way of like, \"Now I got to fly. I\\'m exhausted. I\\'m going to make a fool on\\n01:24:39.120 myself. I don\\'t know any one of these people. It\\'s my first impression. I can I can sit on the couch. Like that\\'s the easy part. The tough part is like life\\n01:24:46.719 has dealt you this opportunity. [\\xa0__\\xa0] say yes. 15 minutes before the show when you get a good idea. The easy thing to\\n01:24:53.600 do is be like, \"Do the show.\" The hard thing to do is be like, \"Yo, let\\'s let\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] swing. Let\\'s go for\\n01:24:59.120 it.\" Yeah. So, it\\'s it\\'s not like I I think those moments happen to a lot of us.\\n01:25:04.159 And it doesn\\'t have to be a lottery ticket. Granted, holy hell, I\\'ve been given a lot of\\n01:25:10.000 lottery tickets, but it could be something as simple as like, \"Yo, you\\'re in a crummy mood. Find a way to be kind.\"\\n01:25:16.719 Like, life just gave you an opportunity. The person getting your coffee is like, \"Yo, have a nice day.\" You could stay crummy or you could be\\n01:25:23.120 like, \"Fuck, thank you very much. Appreciate that. Appreciate your time.\" Like that\\'s an\\n01:25:28.159 opportunity. You know, life is just a matter of like us reacting to what life throws at at us. Pivotal decisions\\n01:25:33.920 and it doesn\\'t need to be a worldchanging decision. I think now I don\\'t want to say nowadays. I think we\\n01:25:40.000 always think that like the decision needs to change the world. No, it\\'s you just need to [\\xa0__\\xa0] commit and do\\n01:25:46.080 something. As a 12-year-old, I want to start working out and I liked it and I just [\\xa0__\\xa0] keep working out. And now\\n01:25:52.719 now I can\\'t live without it. It\\'s part of my life. It\\'s a fabric of my life. But in working out, I\\'ve learned\\n01:25:58.880 structure and discipline, accountability, essentially budget. You if you take in too much and you don\\'t\\n01:26:05.440 spend enough, you\\'re going to have some excess. Like the these lessons that opportunity can teach you if you allow\\n01:26:12.400 it. Me [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. the the thing I spoke about at the beginning like the easiest thing to do is your fault, but if I take\\n01:26:20.000 it as an opportunity of like, all right, you missed. What did we learn? Where\\'s the gain?\\n01:26:25.199 Yeah, you can move forward and I can move forward and wholeheartedly apologize to those I\\'ve hurt along the way. And they\\n01:26:32.400 don\\'t need to forgive me. That\\'s on their terms. I can\\'t control that. But man, this the sleep is a little more sound at night knowing like\\n01:26:39.679 in learning this lesson or having this opportunity. [\\xa0__\\xa0] dude. I kind of trampled on your\\n01:26:45.040 [\\xa0__\\xa0] and I\\'m so sorry. Like, I had had such a shitty relationship with my dad\\n01:26:50.320 and just recently we\\'ve mended fences and he\\'s 80, so I\\'m glad I\\'ve done this cuz I mean, we don\\'t last forever. He\\'s\\n01:26:55.760 going, we\\'re all going in the dirt soon, you know? But I just wanted him to be something else. I always wanted that\\n01:27:02.080 [\\xa0__\\xa0] to change. I wanted him to be something else. And finally, I got out of my own way. The hard thing is\\n01:27:08.239 meeting that guy where he\\'s at. The hard thing is allowing him to be who he is.\\n01:27:13.600 take the weight off my backpack and say like, \"Yo, I might have needed you to be this in my life, but because you\\n01:27:20.480 weren\\'t, man, because of your absence in being uh the dad that I had in my mind,\\n01:27:26.080 I got all these [\\xa0__\\xa0] cool male mentors who kept gave me a key to the gym at 15\\n01:27:32.159 and said, \"You better [\\xa0__\\xa0] be here in the morning.\" And like, dude, I still can feel a key in my hand from Dave\\n01:27:37.360 Knock. Um the the dean of students at Coaching Academy who who bet on me. He was like, \"Man, if you get your grades\\n01:27:43.520 from C\\'s to A\\'s and you play two varsity sports, this place cost in 94, this\\n01:27:49.280 place cost 35 grand a year. We will give you aid and you will have a place to learn.\" And that allowed me to become an\\n01:27:55.120 adult. It allowed me to the opportunity of being in a diverse group of students who, man, there\\'s like royalty that goes\\n01:28:02.639 to that school and then there\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] poor kids. My roommate was a basketball player from Compton and then we got kids\\n01:28:08.880 with generational wealth through their name in buildings after. But when it\\'s just like 450 kids in a social\\n01:28:14.080 experiment, money goes away and you just you you just kick it. So I learned to be friends with everybody. But I wouldn\\'t\\n01:28:20.080 have learned that in West Newbury where it\\'s 99.9% white, 1200 people in the small town, no stop lightss, you either\\n01:28:27.280 leave or you never leave. Like just little little things like that. You know what I\\'m saying? Like little like man I should do this. and\\n01:28:34.880 deciding to meet my dad where he\\'s at and be like, \"Dude, I whatever I thought you were, you\\'re not. You\\'re just you\\n01:28:40.880 and I love you for you.\" And man, when we sit, there\\'s some [\\xa0__\\xa0] that he\\'ll say that\\'s all [\\xa0__\\xa0] up. You know, he said\\n01:28:46.719 some [\\xa0__\\xa0] yesterday that like I don\\'t think John\\'s last opponent should be there. And people listen to him because he\\'s a wrestling fan. He\\'s like in the\\n01:28:53.120 kind of like the weird subculture zeitgeist. And I want to call my dad and be like, \"What the [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you doing?\"\\n01:29:00.159 But then like no, he\\'s doing what he does. this is him. This is the dad I This is the John Cena\\n01:29:05.520 I love. This is this is the guy I can sit down with and and and part of that is\\n01:29:11.600 being able to process all that. But the opportunity I get from that. I\\'ve learned about my father\\'s story. I\\'ve\\n01:29:17.440 learned about what he what he wants to do with his life, why he does what he does, maybe what he wanted to do, dreams he didn\\'t have, so I can gain wisdom\\n01:29:23.679 from there. But it\\'s just that\\'s the hard part. is like getting out of your\\n01:29:28.800 own [\\xa0__\\xa0] way to do the thing you really want to do. The easy thing to do is to hold a grudge\\n01:29:33.840 against my dad. What I really wanted to do was tell my dad I love him and sit down with him and be like, \"Yo, let\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] break bread.\" Yeah.\\n01:29:39.040 Talk about whatever you want. And now we do that. And it\\'s great. But that\\'s like that\\'s a small example of\\n01:29:45.920 the easy thing to do is sit on the couch and say, \"Fuck it. Somebody else\\'s fault.\" Right? The tough thing to do is like life is\\n01:29:52.560 handing me a moment right now. And dude, I don\\'t bat a thousand. I mean, it\\'s more like Major League Baseball. I\\'m hoping 300 gets me in the Hall of Fame.\\n01:29:59.360 Like, if I can capitalize on 30% of the moments that life gives me and squander\\n01:30:04.880 the other 70%, I believe I will go into the ground being like, man, I earned\\n01:30:10.159 life. If you can capitalize on 30% of the moments, you are in the 1% of human\\n01:30:15.679 beings that have ever lived. I earned life. Yeah. So, I\\'m I\\'m just trying to get that make it to Coopertown. Yeah. That\\'s that\\'s the reality. And the\\n01:30:22.719 also the reality is if someone doesn\\'t give you what you need, it it gives you a desire to get what you need.\\n01:30:29.440 So many sometimes it\\'s a gift to not have like doting parents like\\n01:30:34.480 I\\'m like, \"Oh my goodness.\" Like I said, I I would never have gotten those the beautiful guidance I got in life. I\\n01:30:40.480 always had father figures because I was searching for it and they they found me. And I was also savvy\\n01:30:47.520 enough to be like, \"This guy needs to stick in my life for a little bit. I that sucks and he [\\xa0__\\xa0] pushes me but\\n01:30:53.679 I got to keep this guy around. Like just weird stuff like that. I hear a lot of wrestlers a lot of times.\\n01:31:00.000 What do you want to do here? I want to be champion. Okay. The math of that really slim. I never wanted to be a\\n01:31:06.880 [\\xa0__\\xa0] champion. I just wanted to wrestle. And if you\\'re good, it\\'ll take you places where one day you can hold\\n01:31:12.239 one of those. But if you start with a goal of I want to hold one of those, man, am I pigeon holeing my goal. What\\n01:31:18.880 the [\\xa0__\\xa0] do you really want to do? I just wanted to wrestle and if I got fired by WWE, I would have tried to go to Japan. I would have tried to go to\\n01:31:24.719 Mexico. I would have tried to go to the UK. [\\xa0__\\xa0] it. I because I just wanted to do it. But that also meant I would put my\\n01:31:31.040 best foot forward. And I wasn\\'t shackled to I need to be champion or I\\'m not validated. I\\'m not successful,\\n01:31:37.600 right? You know what I\\'m saying? Yeah. Just give me a chance to go out there and get the noise and whatever else falls into place, [\\xa0__\\xa0] it. Cool. Because\\n01:31:44.800 what I want to do is just go out there and be in the arena. It\\'s funny because they talk about the noise the way we\\n01:31:50.159 talk about the laughs. Yeah. It\\'s the same thing. It\\'s the same thing. Totally. It\\'s the same thing. Yeah.\\n01:31:55.360 You know, and I don\\'t need to be the most decorated person, but it\\'s weird\\n01:32:00.400 because in not even trying. I have a resume that people will now measure up against like, oh, that\\'s you got to win\\n01:32:06.560 x amount to to pass the hurdle. So, it\\'s weird. Like, I didn\\'t I didn\\'t even try to do any of that. All I tried to do is\\n01:32:12.800 like, you\\'ll just get me out there. And and when you look at what I\\'ve done and and you\\'ve you\\'ve followed a bit like um\\n01:32:19.840 it was weird. I was in the main event of Wrestlemania this year and to talk to people they were like oh\\n01:32:24.880 man that\\'s crazy. The last main event of Wrestlemania I was in was 2012.\\n01:32:30.400 So you\\'d think that like oh John Cena this guy is everything handed to him. He\\'s always at the top. That was my\\n01:32:36.000 first main event Wrestlemania appearance as an attraction in like 13 years. And\\n01:32:42.000 in that span, I worked new wrestlers. I worked for lower level titles. I sat\\n01:32:48.320 ringside and crushed three beers and then got [\\xa0__\\xa0] squashed by the Undertaker as a fan.\\n01:32:53.440 Yeah. Like I did all sorts of [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know? But it because it was never about like\\n01:32:59.840 I\\'m not a success unless I\\'m in the main event of Wrestlemania. No, that\\'s just a position with a ton of stress. Just\\n01:33:05.600 [\\xa0__\\xa0] get me out in the course. Just get me in the arena. have me in section one shaking hands\\n01:33:12.159 with people from Australia and I\\'ll make it the best [\\xa0__\\xa0] time they ever had. It doesn\\'t matter. Like just get me out\\n01:33:17.280 there. What I don\\'t want to do is sit on the bench, right? You know, so how did you go from that\\n01:33:23.520 into acting? Like what was your first So originally it was a a business\\n01:33:28.960 choice. Vince opened WWE Studios and with the idea of if we make these guys\\n01:33:34.080 movie stars, more people come to the arena. M now as a young 20some on the road people\\n01:33:39.360 chant your name every night I\\'m like more people in the arena that sounds [\\xa0__\\xa0] great and his first movie was\\n01:33:44.880 supposed to be with Steve Austin and the it it fell through they were about to shoot in two weeks so movie\\n01:33:51.600 pre-production is way longer than that but he was like you\\'re going to Australia to film this movie the Marine\\n01:33:57.040 and it it was tough it was tough I went from arrive in a town at noon work out\\n01:34:04.480 get a good meal in, crush the show, have some beers on the ride to the next town,\\n01:34:09.600 fall asleep, do it all again. And it\\'s like this whirlwind of electricity to, okay, you\\'re in hair and makeup at 6:00.\\n01:34:16.000 We\\'re doing an explosion today, so the lights are going to be weird, and we probably will get to you around 5:30\\n01:34:21.440 p.m. You just said it\\'s 6:00 in the morning. Yeah.\\n01:34:26.480 So, what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] you want me to do from here until 5:30? I just hang out. And I\\n01:34:31.679 couldn\\'t like as a young 20some, I wanted to be in the electricity. I couldn\\'t handle the the nature of the\\n01:34:38.719 business. Yeah. And therefore, my passion wasn\\'t in it. I wasn\\'t fully invested in it. I am I am\\n01:34:44.080 [\\xa0__\\xa0] here with you guys right now. We are talking about this. My my mind isn\\'t elsewhere on other [\\xa0__\\xa0] I I want this\\n01:34:50.800 to be what I want to give you all I got. So, I\\'m here with you. I was never there in those movies. I was always back in\\n01:34:56.480 [\\xa0__\\xa0] maybe if I had the feud with this guy or if I could have done this. I was never there. and you could see it in the performance.\\n01:35:01.679 So, I kind of got run out of the movie business. I did so many shitty movies in like 2009 10. My my best friend agent\\n01:35:08.639 Dan Bame at the time I was like, \"Man, we\\'re never doing movies again.\" Right? And you know, as an agent is supposed to\\n01:35:14.960 be the guy to pick you up, he looks at me dead. He goes, \"Nope, we will find another way though.\" He was honest. We are never do we run out of town,\\n01:35:21.760 but we\\'ll find another way. So, we did. We did um hosted some live shows. Uh um\\n01:35:28.000 hosted some game shows. did little appearances here and there and then uh Jud Appattow and Amy Schumer gave me a\\n01:35:34.239 chance on um uh gosh, Train Wreck and it was a very\\n01:35:39.840 small part but again like just just get out in the arena and do your best and and look I was in a [\\xa0__\\xa0] room with\\n01:35:47.280 comics like funny people. I don\\'t belong there. But they they created an\\n01:35:52.960 environment where I wasn\\'t judged. They only showed the good jokes. that didn\\'t they didn\\'t show the [\\xa0__\\xa0] 20 takes or\\n01:35:58.880 I tried to tell jokes that sucked. The only ones that made the final cut were the ones that made people laugh. So they\\n01:36:04.159 they provided an opportunity for failure. And at that point I\\'ve been playing the same character. This is 2014\\n01:36:10.960 15. I\\'ve been playing the same character on TV for 15 [\\xa0__\\xa0] years. And now I\\'m like, yo, I get to do something\\n01:36:16.400 different. I can do this for 12 hours. You want me to sit? I\\'ll go [\\xa0__\\xa0] read a book. I don\\'t care. I\\'m in. So I\\n01:36:22.800 accepted the patient process of movies. M and then after that I I I got a little\\n01:36:28.400 bit of noise and train wreck and then Jud sent word to Tina Fay and Amy Polar who were filming up the road in Long\\n01:36:33.840 Island be like if you got a spot you should hire the kid and they made me a drug dealer and their thing and then\\n01:36:39.600 like things started to roll downhill but it was very very small parts at a time\\n01:36:45.520 and here I am that was 2015 here I am a decade later and I\\'m still trying to\\n01:36:51.360 advance to fluency. By no means am I like I\\'m the the 17time champ of the the\\n01:36:56.719 acting community. Those were the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I was looking at when I was naked, you know, right? I\\'m aspiring to try to be that. But it\\'s\\n01:37:04.880 basically the pivot happened when I was like, yo, if you just invest in this,\\n01:37:10.800 the hustle you and patience you put into wrestling, at least you know, you gave it your all.\\n01:37:17.360 you know, be coachable, be professional, be reliable, be interested, and and see\\n01:37:22.639 where the chips fly and and [\\xa0__\\xa0] say yes. Well, it\\'s also you had the\\n01:37:28.639 the objectivity, like the the introspective objectivity to look at your past performances and say, I wasn\\'t\\n01:37:35.840 really in there. I wasn\\'t. And I got run out of town. Yeah. I lost the job. So, like, here\\'s that\\n01:37:41.520 here\\'s that mulligan. What? [\\xa0__\\xa0] I\\'m I\\'ll I\\'ll never work in this town again. I will. All right, let\\'s go. Let\\'s try.\\n01:37:47.760 What else could go wrong? They\\'ve already fired me, you know? So, again, an environment and\\n01:37:53.920 no one does it alone. The the people I was around, uh Tina and Amy are the same way. Like, only show the funny [\\xa0__\\xa0] but\\n01:38:00.159 try whatever you want. Like, fail. It\\'s okay. And just because you\\'re around people who do comedy for a living, all\\n01:38:06.560 we need is three seconds, and we\\'ll be patient enough to give you what you need to give us that 3 seconds,\\n01:38:12.639 you know? Yeah. It\\'s uh it\\'s just such a fun story, you know, and there\\'s so there\\'s\\n01:38:19.600 only a few guys that have managed to make that leap from WWE. Obviously, The Rock is the big one.\\n01:38:24.880 Sure. You know, I mean, he\\'s the biggest one to make that leap and now become a giant movie star.\\n01:38:29.920 Well, I think it\\'s a I think it\\'s a leap a lot of people can make. Uh it\\'s not from from lack of talent. We talk about\\n01:38:36.000 like obstacles and like we\\'re in our own way. WWE is all consuming. And you got to\\n01:38:41.920 remember like I I was their biggest act. So at 220 shows a year for me to be\\n01:38:48.480 like, \"Hey, I need six months off to film this action movie.\" That really [\\xa0__\\xa0] with the bottom line.\\n01:38:54.080 Like Oh, yeah. So So the answer is no. Right. You know, and and and now with less live\\n01:39:00.639 events, it\\'s still you you want to be on television. It\\'s like, okay, I need to\\n01:39:06.080 somehow leverage my relevance with this to the what it\\'s going to do to film that in WWE. If you\\'re not, I\\'m going to\\n01:39:12.960 retire on the 13th. They will be moved on by the Royal Rumble. And that\\'s that is real facts. I\\n01:39:20.080 will be forgotten. That is not a plea of sympathy of like always remember me by the Royal Rumble and the Road\\n01:39:25.440 Wrestlemania. Nobody gives a [\\xa0__\\xa0] because they\\'re focusing on what the show is. That\\'s like three weeks after I\\n01:39:32.639 retire. three weeks after I retire, nobody\\'s gonna give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] And that\\'s not I\\'m\\n01:39:38.000 not saying like what I did was meaningless. I\\'ve lived the moments. They\\'re great. People move on. So when\\n01:39:43.840 if I\\'m a talent who\\'s on TV and finally got one of those spots and edged my way in, do I is this the right time to\\n01:39:51.199 leverage taking myself off of TV to do four months on something that isn\\'t\\n01:39:56.719 going to come out for another 18 months and then I got to go back to TV hoping people still care that my my ring work\\n01:40:03.040 is still polished that I still have my finger on the pulse. Like it\\'s it is we can get in our own way sometimes. You\\n01:40:09.360 know what I\\'m saying? Yeah. So I I I was just at the point in 15, 16, 17\\n01:40:16.159 where I was like, man, my body\\'s kind of banged up. I\\'m a little older. I would\\n01:40:21.360 like to take some time off. And how I talked about like every five years we needed somebody in the on deck circle.\\n01:40:27.119 So I\\'m I\\'m running at the front for like 15. They needed someone in the on deck circle and then they finally got some\\n01:40:33.840 folks. So they\\'re like, \"Yo, we got we got folks. Yeah, go do the thing. It\\'s fine. Go do it.\" So my my passion for it\\n01:40:40.960 was ignited at the perfect time when when the office side of it was like that won\\'t affect our bottom line too much.\\n01:40:47.840 Go give this thing a try. So it it again just happy accident man and\\n01:40:53.679 I\\'m I\\'m grateful for it. So now you\\'re in the situation you\\'re going to retire. Yep.\\n01:40:58.719 And then are you just going to go all in on acting now? So that\\'s again beyond my control. If I\\n01:41:06.080 could if I could Is that the goal though? Is that what you would like? Uh the the goal is to live useful.\\n01:41:13.119 That\\'s it. The goal is to live useful and and not lack like a depth of purpose in my life,\\n01:41:19.119 you know? I can\\'t control if the phone rings and they say, \"We want the kid in the picture.\" That\\'s way beyond me. What\\n01:41:24.480 I can do is when someone bets on me, do my [\\xa0__\\xa0] damnest. For every dollar, I want to give him 10 back. I want to show\\n01:41:31.199 them that you I want to show you your time was well spent today. I want to give you by heart and soul. And when I leave here, you may be like, uh, not my\\n01:41:37.679 cup of tea, but the [\\xa0__\\xa0] kid\\'s all right. You know, like that\\'s that\\'s all I\\'m trying to do. So, if I can do that,\\n01:41:44.080 maybe I get another maybe I get another match. Maybe I get another phone call. But I also realize my mortality in in\\n01:41:51.840 the retirement, like it\\'s over. But also, there\\'ll come a day where y\\'all out there are like, \"Ah, the kid\\'s not\\n01:41:58.159 not cool anymore. I\\'m done. I\\'m on to the next shiny thing.\" I\\'m grateful for what I got. And I know I don\\'t control\\n01:42:04.400 how many times the phone rings. I just wanna I never want to phone it in, right? And and when my time is up, it\\'s over\\n01:42:10.639 with, man. I like I\\'ll I\\'ll do the rest of whatever life is. So, do you think about that? Like what the\\n01:42:16.000 rest of life is? Do you have other interests? I sure do. Sure do. Um love messing around\\n01:42:21.360 with music. I I never read as a kid, so I\\'m reading more than I ever have. Um love cars. Love to I\\'d love to just\\n01:42:28.159 drive the like just being in a car and driving. not track stuff, just like going on long drives. Love that. I see a\\n01:42:34.960 bunch of sticks. I love an occasional stick with some conversation. Uh I love boy did I miss out on loving connections\\n01:42:42.080 in my life. So I\\'m like I have them now and they\\'re [\\xa0__\\xa0] so cool. So if if a\\n01:42:48.159 day is just spent with friends or a week or like man with WWE, I\\'ve been around\\n01:42:53.920 the world like 12 times. I haven\\'t seen [\\xa0__\\xa0] I\\'ve seen the inside of arenas, a\\n01:42:59.199 hotel bar, and a [\\xa0__\\xa0] airport. Yeah. I want to know what Tokyo is all about.\\n01:43:04.400 I\\'ve been there like 20 times. I haven\\'t seen [\\xa0__\\xa0] you know? Like I And and I don\\'t know if I\\'ll ever get tired of\\n01:43:10.400 that. Like um I always have a curious nature on to to what\\'s next. I don\\'t\\n01:43:17.440 know what that\\'ll be, but I\\'m I never want to wake up and be like, man, life\\'s taking forever.\\n01:43:23.840 You know what I\\'m saying? I think there\\'s always something to do with the day. So, I don\\'t I don\\'t know. Would I\\n01:43:28.880 love to continue to tell stories and get paid for it? [\\xa0__\\xa0] that\\'s a great gig, but it\\'s also beyond my control. So,\\n01:43:35.760 instead of being like, I\\'m going all in on acting and I want to do this and one day I want to win an Oscar. And I\\'m not\\n01:43:41.679 saying that approach is bad. I\\'m just saying my approach is like, man, when they do call, be grateful. And don\\'t be\\n01:43:47.760 grateful in the easy times. Be grateful when they ask you to work a 16 hour day or be grateful in that press tour when\\n01:43:53.840 you have to read off the or when you get to read off the prompter and you\\'re doing 86 reads and the reads are so you\\n01:43:59.440 can dress up in the costume and all that other [\\xa0__\\xa0] Like that\\'s that\\'s kind of more where I\\'m at. That\\'s a great\\n01:44:05.199 approach to life. How did you develop this philosophy is dude I\\'m not supposed to be here. Like I\\'m from [\\xa0__\\xa0] West\\n01:44:12.960 Newbury, Massachusetts. I\\'m not supposed to be here. And and that\\'s another thing. There\\'s not a day that doesn\\'t go\\n01:44:18.719 by where I look at someone I love and connect with and be like, \"Man, what a life.\" I I understand how lucky I am,\\n01:44:26.239 and I understand I have been awarded more opportunity than one human being should get. And\\n01:44:32.880 it\\'s it\\'s um from what I\\'ve tried to boil down to it, the best way to honor\\n01:44:38.960 that opportunity is to do your best to try to live a good life. And a good life isn\\'t it\\'s that that\\'s\\n01:44:46.239 almost like pain. Everybody\\'s perspective of a good life is different. I\\'ve come up with core values and I try\\n01:44:52.239 to live by those. [\\xa0__\\xa0] I\\'m human. I ain\\'t perfect. But like again,\\n01:44:58.159 if when I go into the dirt, I feel as if I didn\\'t waste it. And I don\\'t mean grind. Like homeboy from Nvidia, that\\'s\\n01:45:04.000 that\\'s a grind. And I think a lot of him there\\'s fear there, but also a lot of a\\n01:45:09.119 lot of that effort, he loves it. And that\\'s what that\\'s what an ideal life to him is about. And if he goes in the\\n01:45:15.199 ground working 70 hours a week, he\\'ll go in with a smile on his face, you know? I just want to go in when it\\'s my time, I\\n01:45:22.960 want to know that I honored the luck I was given by not [\\xa0__\\xa0] squandering it,\\n01:45:28.560 by not wasting it. And that doesn\\'t mean grind to a monetary number. It just means live a\\n01:45:34.800 fulfilled life where the sleep is sound, the love is real, and every day you\\'re\\n01:45:40.000 driven with curiosity and purpose. And I don\\'t know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] that is. And it could change. Man, I thought I was born to be a WWE superstar. And then the\\n01:45:47.199 elbows start hurting a little bit and you\\'re like, \"Ah, man. I\\'m born to be a storyteller.\" And then you realize that like I\\'m not\\n01:45:53.520 in control of any of that [\\xa0__\\xa0] That\\'s just luck. That\\'s somebody being like, \"I liked him in this. Put him in that.\"\\n01:45:59.600 Yes, no problem. Well, I think a key factor you\\'re talking about here is gratitude. I was born to to honor the luck that\\n01:46:06.000 I\\'ve been given. Yeah. And just try to do my best to live a full life. Like that\\'s it.\\n01:46:11.679 Yeah. And that having gratitude about the life that you live and being happy. God, it\\'s so hard but so important.\\n01:46:18.480 And it it\\'s tough when you use that word because it\\'s such a I know it\\'s a new age.\\n01:46:23.600 Think outside the box like but no man. Like it\\'s a real word though. Real thanks.\\n01:46:29.280 Yes. is hard. Yeah. Because you have to be thankful for the suck, for the pain.\\n01:46:35.040 You have to be thankful for the lesson, for the journey. Like, and these are again, these are all like slangy\\n01:46:40.639 hashtaggy terms. I don\\'t know what the [\\xa0__\\xa0] else to call it, so I\\'m just calling it what it is. They\\'ve been they\\'ve been co-opted by\\n01:46:46.400 people that just sort of [\\xa0__\\xa0] and use those words. But the reality of those words is strong. It\\'s very\\n01:46:51.520 powerful. It\\'s like like grind. Grind is another hashtag word, you know, but like there is there is some realism to it.\\n01:46:58.400 But that that From what I figured it out thus far, that\\'s my path. And uh when\\n01:47:04.480 the facts change, so does my opinion. So we could come back here in a few years and I I\\'d be on some other [\\xa0__\\xa0] But\\n01:47:09.600 right now, that\\'s kind of where I\\'m at. Well, it\\'s such a the the gratitude word has been really co-opted by goofy\\n01:47:16.159 people, unfortunately. But it doesn\\'t mean you shouldn\\'t use it. It\\'s the real word. And and if if if the word makes you feel\\n01:47:23.760 weird, come up with your own word. Right. Thanks. Yeah. Whatever. Having thanks. I\\'m with you there. Some\\n01:47:30.800 some words make me feel gross just about how overused they\\'ve been, but like I I I can\\'t stray away from that one.\\n01:47:36.560 Yeah. Yeah. I mean, we talk about gratitude all the time. We We\\'re always like talking about how we\\'re living the\\n01:47:42.480 dream. Yeah. Like just being What are we doing? We\\'re just shooting the [\\xa0__\\xa0] I know. People are paying attention.\\n01:47:47.840 I know. The [\\xa0__\\xa0] you guys doing? A lot a lot of people. If you\\'re still with us, I can\\'t believe it. This is\\n01:47:53.119 great. Yeah. I was thinking uh I was talking to my buddy the other day, Peter Shore, the owner of the comedy store, and I was\\n01:47:59.679 telling him about how just a few weeks ago because I\\'m now that I have a place\\n01:48:05.920 that I like and a car that I like and a job and everything, everything\\'s finally\\n01:48:11.040 it appears how I have always considered what the dream is. that uh I was saying\\n01:48:18.400 to my buddy the other day who I came up with who I really started with and I\\'m talking about like 14 16-hour days at\\n01:48:24.639 the comedy store. I\\'d answer the phone at 11:00 a.m. because back then they didn\\'t even have a website. Hello, you\\n01:48:30.000 want to you want tickets tonight? Blah blah blah blah. Work all night, put on the t-shirt at 8:00 p.m. tear tickets\\n01:48:36.159 and check IDs until 2:30 in the morning. So I would hit ex I would hit overtime\\n01:48:42.080 by like Wednesday or Thursday, but they couldn\\'t pay overtime because the comedy store in 2007 was half to quarter empty.\\n01:48:49.920 Anyway, so they would cut my hours and I was paying $400 a month to sleep on my\\n01:48:55.280 buddy\\'s couch in his living room and he had a bedroom and my other buddy Maddie had a bedroom, but Sandy was like, you\\n01:49:02.800 know, he was like the apartment was registered in his name. And I mean, terrible couch, terrible setup. I\\'d have\\n01:49:08.639 to go through one of their bedrooms to go to the bathroom. So, if you have to pee in the middle of the night, you\\'re kind of tiptoeing\\n01:49:14.880 through, you know, you don\\'t want to make noise. You don\\'t know what you\\'re gonna see, whatever. And I was talking to Matt a month or so\\n01:49:21.840 ago and I go, I think I still owe Sandy a little bit of rent money because I just simply didn\\'t have it back then.\\n01:49:27.600 Isn\\'t that crazy? He goes, you do. I He mentioned it last time as we were\\n01:49:33.280 talking about how successful you are. There\\'s an accountant right there. So, I Venmoed him out of nowhere. I haven\\'t even we haven\\'t even talked\\n01:49:39.440 since pre- pandemic. He\\'s got a family. I\\'m out here. This that I Venmo him a\\n01:49:44.560 thousand bucks out of nowhere. And I go 2007 rent money as the uh as the um the\\n01:49:51.600 memo part of it. And he hits me up saying thanks and we\\'re communicating. And then I remembered that at one point\\n01:49:58.159 I couldn\\'t even afford the $400 a month uh for the couch. And there was another\\n01:50:05.119 comedian that was a door guy at the store that did have the 400 a month because he was getting help from his parents. So I got downgraded to a bean\\n01:50:11.600 bag for like a month or two. I was sleeping. Oh, just horrendous. Exactly. A sore back for two months just in pain\\n01:50:19.119 all the time but doing what I loved. So much of what you\\'re saying about enjoying the process. Enjoy what you\\'re\\n01:50:25.840 doing because I really did back then. And I think about that now more. I\\'ve been thinking about that bean bag and\\n01:50:31.920 that couch and that living room more than ever the last few months. You know,\\n01:50:36.960 it\\'s like that\\'s talking about gratitude. It\\'s like those are the things that that\\'s who you are is\\n01:50:43.679 enjoying that process, you know, and making the best out of it. And in in in my case of a similar story\\n01:50:50.639 and from what I\\'m hearing from you is like you you wanted to be there. You you were not going to give up the bean bag.\\n01:50:55.679 Oh yeah. There\\'s there\\'s a lot of folks out there who are put behind the eightball and really have to dig themselves out of a trench. When I moved\\n01:51:02.639 out to Venice and I was working at Golds, I was sleeping in the parking lot in my 91 Continental and everybody\\'s like, \"Oh man, you were\\n01:51:08.320 homeless.\" I\\'m like, \"No, no choice. It was my choice.\" Yeah. I didn\\'t want to leave. My old man had a\\n01:51:13.600 room for me. Nobody ever leaves West Newbury. My dad was like, \"Yo, come back. You got a roof over your head. You get some [\\xa0__\\xa0] up job over here. You\\n01:51:19.440 don\\'t have to pay rent.\" So, I had choice. I stayed in the car cuz I wanted to. Yeah.\\n01:51:24.480 Life was great. I got to see like the bodybuilders of the 2000s. I got to train at the gym and shower at the gym\\n01:51:31.199 and the rock came through. There\\'s like a old picture of me in the rock somewhere where I\\'m in my gold gym club\\n01:51:36.880 store shirt and he\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] doing the the this one and like I got to see all these people and it was [\\xa0__\\xa0] cool.\\n01:51:42.639 And I I wouldn\\'t have left if they took the car away and I got to sleep in the parking lot. Like I I was by choice, you\\n01:51:49.440 know? You you slept on the bean bag cuz you wanted to be there. And the fun fact is look at that. That\\'s uh that\\'s that\\'s that\\'s me in the\\n01:51:56.639 background right there. No, no, no. Keep that. Hold on. I\\'m taking the phones off. I\\'m going in. Yeah, that\\'s me right there. He had just taken\\n01:52:02.719 a photo with me and that\\'s me. Wow. That\\'s DJ. Wow.\\n01:52:08.159 Wow. Yeah, that\\'s crazy. That\\'s 1999.\\n01:52:13.360 Wow. [\\xa0__\\xa0] rock was white hot. Selling out every place. Probably Staple Center\\n01:52:18.960 Anaheim coming in to press some weights. Wow. Wow. That\\'s crazy.\\n01:52:24.480 Yeah. What a what a That So, like that\\'s where the perspective is exists. Yeah.\\n01:52:29.840 Because I shouldn\\'t have even been in the [\\xa0__\\xa0] club store selling candy bars. I should be, you know, in in in\\n01:52:35.679 West Newberry doing what everyone else does. Like, that\\'s the that\\'s the tale, you know, and I\\'m not. So, I\\'m grateful\\n01:52:43.520 for it. Yeah. Yeah. There\\'s a lot of people out there on bean bags right now listening to this. You need to hear. Stay on the bean bag.\\n01:52:50.159 24 more hours. Who knows? 24 more hours, something could happen. Yeah. And the the success would be so\\n01:52:56.560 much sweeter. All so much sweeter if you do it that way. I mean, if you were a trust fund kid and you had plenty of money and your\\n01:53:02.800 parents gave you 100 grand a year to go out and pursue your dreams and they paid for your apartment and\\n01:53:09.199 man, you know, I don\\'t want to [\\xa0__\\xa0] on anybody\\'s flex. You You\\'re right. But at the same time, same\\n01:53:14.800 if if you understand that, right? If you understand I was put on the board ahead of everybody else. I was born on third\\n01:53:21.040 base. That\\'s again that shit\\'s beyond your control, right? But I think you need some failure to understand that.\\n01:53:27.119 So if you\\'re grateful for what you have, you will swing and miss and and be\\n01:53:33.440 accountable. I think because you can\\'t really control what you have. You can\\'t control where you start, right?\\n01:53:39.280 You can\\'t control your start. You control where you\\'re going. So if or how you respond along the way.\\n01:53:44.480 Yeah. and and the kind of person you are to somebody who was born on third base I\\n01:53:50.960 think also will dictate your perception uh from the from the eyes of others. If\\n01:53:57.280 you feel you are greater than, [\\xa0__\\xa0] we\\'re all human beings, dog. Like, nobody greater than nobody,\\n01:54:02.320 right? You know, uh, everybody\\'s out there struggling and and all of us, especially in this area of the the pale blue dot.\\n01:54:09.199 We all believe in capitalism. So, so the fact that you were born on third base means everybody\\'s doing their job and the whole system\\'s working. Like, you\\n01:54:16.639 can\\'t think you\\'re when you start getting the like I I never use this word. I feel bad even saying it.\\n01:54:21.840 Deserve. When you start getting the deserve mentality of I deserve this. [\\xa0__\\xa0] it. What the [\\xa0__\\xa0] do you deserve,\\n01:54:27.199 man? Yeah, that\\'s crazy. You know, have you earned this? Have you earned it? And if you feel as if you\\n01:54:33.199 haven\\'t, what steps are you going to take to earn it? If you\\'re born on third and you feel bad about it, take some\\n01:54:39.760 steps to feel good about it. I don\\'t know what that is, but if you\\'re born on third and you feel you deserve it\\n01:54:45.920 to me, that\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] sprinting through a minefield, dog. Yeah, that\\'s not a good path. And I don\\'t I don\\'t ever I don\\'t ever want to\\n01:54:52.800 [\\xa0__\\xa0] with somebody who turns like a hundred,000 into 10 million or a million into a billion. That\\'s good investing.\\n01:54:59.280 That\\'s I mean that that\\'s the system. You you you learned how to work the system. It\\'s just in the process if you\\n01:55:05.280 think you think you\\'re better than Yeah. murky waters, man. In in in my\\n01:55:10.880 perspective. Well, it\\'s just a terrible perspective anyway. Like you\\'re just like cuz it\\'s all right.\\n01:55:16.159 It\\'s all kind of fugazy. Like it\\'s all just paper IUs or whatever. It\\'s digital ones and zeros like are if it melts down\\n01:55:23.360 are you really better than anybody? You know, well a lot of times it\\'s also a defense mechanism.\\n01:55:28.480 You know, you pretend that you deserve it. You pretend you\\'re better than other people because maybe you don\\'t feel enough or\\n01:55:33.599 again everybody\\'s walking through their own mile, but like I don\\'t feel validated or or I want attention or I\\n01:55:39.760 don\\'t know. I don\\'t know, man. I don\\'t know. Yeah. Yeah. It was crazy hanging out with\\n01:55:45.440 Steph McMahon and how human she was and hilarious and human. I was telling her\\n01:55:50.960 cuz I was telling her like, man, you know, I always wanted to be a pro wrestler when I was a kid. And then I\\n01:55:56.000 realized I wasn\\'t going to be tall enough and I wasn\\'t going to be big enough. And then lately I\\'ve been meeting these guys and they\\'re not that\\n01:56:01.520 huge. And when I tell them that they go, \"Look at me.\" You know, Sami Zayn, hilarious guy,\\n01:56:07.280 literally told me that. He\\'s like, \"You could have done it.\" I\\'m like, \"Yeah, I guess I could have actually done it. You could probably still do it.\" And I\\n01:56:13.440 was telling Steph that she goes, \"Do you think you can do a little something?\" I go, \"I can hit a super kick on anybody\\n01:56:18.800 at any time from any place.\" It\\'s Shawn Michaels finishing move. It\\'s like kick.\\n01:56:24.800 You would literally you would faint from laughter because you actually know how to [\\xa0__\\xa0] kick through a wall,\\n01:56:31.280 but it\\'s a it\\'s a it\\'s a kick and and the goal is not to hit the guy to\\n01:56:37.920 come real close. Y and she\\'s so cool. She goes, \"Oh, that\\'d be funny if next time, you know, I\\'m\\n01:56:42.960 with Triple H, you just super kick me out of nowhere. I\\'ll sell it. I\\'ll fall down the whole thing.\" I\\'m like, \"I know, Stephanie. This is crazy.\"\\n01:56:50.480 There we go. There it is. That\\'s a perfect example. Come on. There it is, man. This is You\\'re on it. Okay. So, a guy flies through the air\\n01:56:56.639 and you kind of catch him. That\\'s just one example. Like, that\\'s a that\\'s a really good example right here.\\n01:57:01.760 But it could be from It could be from standing anywhere. It\\'s just a pretty much that high that high kick. You can do that.\\n01:57:07.040 I can do that. I can You\\'re flexible like that. I\\'m flexible. At least I think I am. I don\\'t know.\\n01:57:12.400 We\\'ll see. I wasn\\'t th was throwing a rock at the tree the other day for the first time in forever and I coming up\\n01:57:19.520 about 15 ft shorter than ever before. There. That\\'s what she looks like. Yep. Whoa. That looks real.\\n01:57:26.960 Yep. Yeah, it\\'s on there. Looks like it\\'s really hit. It\\'s on there. Two of the best right there. It\\'s on there.\\n01:57:32.800 Yep. You really got that kind of flexibility? Yep. You slap your leg at the same time and it makes everybody actually think\\n01:57:39.280 that you did it. Like if I did it to somebody, you\\'d be like, \"Dude, you just [\\xa0__\\xa0] kicked them because slap the like stomp around when you\\n01:57:46.719 punch.\" Yeah. Yeah. Slide a hand. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There\\'s magic in the business, man.\\n01:57:51.760 There is. I want to see you out there. Hey, I wrestled with my pillow for like\\n01:57:56.800 eight hours a day as a kid. I would do the entrances. I would record off of the cassette player. Remember how you used\\n01:58:03.040 to have to record? Dude, I had a whole We had a whole league in our basement. Yeah. With I I didn\\'t need the pillows cuz I\\n01:58:08.480 had four brothers. We had belts, a league, personas like And in one persona, I would get my ass\\n01:58:13.920 kicked all the time. And then there was one persona that could not [\\xa0__\\xa0] lose. Like we kept standings and stuff. Yeah.\\n01:58:19.119 Yeah. It\\'s It\\'s Oh, yeah. I don\\'t know, man. I don\\'t know. That\\'s amazing. My brothers and sisters were all much\\n01:58:25.119 older, but we had a music class teacher in my grade school that didn\\'t give a [\\xa0__\\xa0] about his job. We would just sit in\\n01:58:31.119 the corner and play piano the whole time and let the kids do whatever we wanted. And again, we had entrance music. We\\n01:58:37.119 were all different people all the time. We\\'d run it back again. The entire 45\\n01:58:42.400 minutes jumping off of desks, cabinets, chairs. It\\'s crazy how many injuries\\n01:58:49.280 didn\\'t happen. It\\'s amazing how resilient uh kids can be when we were\\n01:58:54.480 that the energy of youth just bulletproof. God. Yeah. It doesn\\'t make sense how arms and\\n01:59:00.159 legs and heads and necks weren\\'t broken. You also don\\'t weigh that much back then. That\\'s part of who you\\'re Man,\\n01:59:06.639 you\\'re so full of energy. Man, I I can tell I\\'m getting old cuz I can be like, \"Is that chair okay?\\n01:59:13.040 Is it I\\'m I\\'m going to be sitting for a while. Am I going to be all right? Is everything going to be good?\" I\\'m like, \"Oh, man. This bed\\'s going to kill me.\"\\n01:59:18.560 Yeah. Just laying down like this. The bean bag. Oh my god. Oh, I\\'d spend four hours in that thing. You have to cart me off.\\n01:59:24.239 I think I\\'d just sleep on the ground rather than the bean bag. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Back then it seemed like the\\n01:59:30.639 better option. It was the better option. Yeah, probably. That\\'s hilarious though. Yeah.\\n01:59:36.080 Have you talked to them about possibly doing something? Uh,\\n01:59:41.280 I mean, no, not exactly. At one point there was a little a little chatter, but\\n01:59:47.840 come on, dude. I think you can come up with an Royal Rumble right around the corner. I have big shoes to fill over here.\\n01:59:54.400 Sturdy entrance. We need We need bodies. Yeah, I show Speed did a good job at that,\\n02:00:00.000 man. He got drilled out of his boots. He took uh uh the streamer, famous\\n02:00:06.239 streamer, internet guy. He took what\\'s called a bump from hell.\\n02:00:11.520 Uh he got speared at the Was that the Rumble? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, he was. The other spontaneous\\n02:00:16.960 guy. He does some wild [\\xa0__\\xa0] He does. He got in the cage with Dan uh the hangman hooker.\\n02:00:22.239 Yeah. And he\\'s he\\'s like he\\'s game for anything. Yeah. He has like um like a kinesthetic\\n02:00:28.480 awareness. Like he\\'s he\\'s obviously an athlete. Yeah. And he\\'s brave. Like\\n02:00:34.000 look at this [\\xa0__\\xa0] Watch this mother just leave screen. Say it. Oh man.\\n02:00:40.080 Oh my god. You can\\'t fake that. Oh my god. But like you also have to the reason\\n02:00:46.080 that looks so good. A lot of that is because of Braun, but also a lot of that is because of I show speed. He committed\\n02:00:51.520 to the fall and really tried to fall with snap and with quickness. Like he\\'s\\n02:00:56.960 he\\'s good, man. He really is good. And like you said, like I I\\'ve seen a lot of the other stuff he does. He he does\\n02:01:02.800 well. He\\'ll get in there and mess around, you know. Oh, yeah. Well, he really sparred with Dan Hooker and Dan beat the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of\\n02:01:08.239 him, but he hung in there. Yeah. Yeah. It\\'s just it\\'s crazy enough to try, you know. It\\'s also interesting these YouTube\\n02:01:14.400 guys, they\\'re just becoming famous and there was no avenue for them before. you\\n02:01:20.000 know, they would have had to have been cast in a TV show or become something else. Limited spots. Yeah. And now they\\'re doing it\\n02:01:26.239 completely on their own and becoming huge. I mean, he\\'s got like 50 million Instagram followers or something crazy.\\n02:01:32.080 Yeah. And and a bunch of content and a bunch of revenue to match that. And like and always working, always doing\\n02:01:38.560 something, puts himself out there. Those guys hustle and it\\'s all all the\\n02:01:43.679 content creators out there. People don\\'t understand the hours. They\\'re they they may end up getting\\n02:01:50.400 some financial reward, but when you break it down to hourly wage, they\\'re working 24 hours a day,\\n02:01:56.960 7 days a week. Like they don\\'t stop because it\\'s a lot of the content they make will have short shelf life. It\\'s\\n02:02:03.679 not they\\'re not they\\'re not essentially putting Gone with the Wind out in the universe. Like it\\'s like you got you\\'re only as good as your next one, not the\\n02:02:09.920 your last one or the one you did. It\\'s like you\\'re only as good as what you\\'re doing five minutes from now. And if you drop off the map, someone will replace\\n02:02:16.320 you like there\\'s so many [\\xa0__\\xa0] streamers. There\\'s so many people that are doing content. And they they work hard. They do. They\\n02:02:22.639 work hard. And even even the the ones where it seems like, man, to a a perspective of like, I don\\'t\\n02:02:29.199 understand this. Still the effort that goes into that. And it\\'s not just what you saw. It\\'s like, okay, you got to have a repeat performance and then you\\n02:02:35.280 got to keep coming and keep coming and keep coming. Like I do a movie and like I said, it\\'s out in 18 months. In 18\\n02:02:41.440 months, they\\'ve already put out 10,000 videos, right? Like it\\'s it\\'s bananas.\\n02:02:47.199 It is interesting that nobody saw that coming, too. Nobody ever thought that that was going to be a thing. I just think it\\'s cuz we get so used to\\n02:02:53.760 stuff. Mhm. We get so used to consuming in a certain way. When something is new for us, it\\'s\\n02:03:00.719 like, ah man, I don\\'t know if that\\'s going to take off. But there are young people who are experiencing everything at the same time and like, no, this is\\n02:03:07.199 cooler, right? It\\'s way easier to do this. Also, he\\'s really young and when you start young,\\n02:03:12.400 there\\'s not a lot of expectations on you. No, you you can kind of just do whatever you want and if it works, great.\\n02:03:18.239 Not young and courageous, too. Like, go just go for it. Yeah. Yeah. It\\'s it\\'s And it\\'s also a great example\\n02:03:24.960 for other people that that are thinking like, I\\'m kind of entertaining. I just don\\'t have an avenue. Let me just start\\n02:03:30.960 making videos. You got a phone? Yeah. You got a chance. Isn\\'t that crazy? That\\'s all you have to do is have a phone.\\n02:03:36.480 It\\'s nuts. You see the videos where he was uh sprinting with uh Ashton Forbes, you know that super jacked guy\\n02:03:43.440 that does that morning routine that everybody made fun of because he has this like morning routine where he dunks his face in water and then he someone\\n02:03:50.239 hands him his gold watch and he puts it on. It\\'s like really kind of silly. Yeah. Huh. you know, and he had a whole series\\n02:03:56.639 of races with him because he he couldn\\'t believe that this YouTuber guy could beat him because he\\'s like this [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n02:04:02.159 superjed ripped guy who a lot of his online content is him running and he\\n02:04:07.840 just looks like a force of nature and I show speed beat him like three times in these races, but he didn\\'t want to a\\n02:04:15.119 believe that he lost so he wanted to do it again. Let\\'s do it again. Let\\'s do it again. I show Speed\\'s talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] to him. He did it again.\\n02:04:21.760 Sorry. See if you can find it. It\\'s very funny. It\\'s very funny because when you look at the the guy like this guy looks\\n02:04:27.280 like he could run like a horse and I show speed is actually faster than him.\\n02:04:32.400 I think he he sprinted an actual Olympic sprinter. I mean he started [\\xa0__\\xa0] around a little bit but he held his own.\\n02:04:39.040 That\\'s crazy. Yeah. That\\'s crazy. He was like right there with an Olympic sprinter. That\\'s nuts. I\\n02:04:44.639 think he won the gold the guy that he raced. Really? That\\'s He\\'s like right next to him.\\n02:04:50.400 That\\'s crazy. Like and he\\'s not even [\\xa0__\\xa0] training like that guy is. Imagine if he was like that [\\xa0__\\xa0] guy\\n02:04:57.679 if he wanted to like fully invest himself into sprinting.\\n02:05:02.800 Imag he\\'s only what 20 20 years old. That\\'s wild. Wow. Really? Imagine if that kid fully invested in\\n02:05:09.520 that and then became an Olympic gold medalist as well. So that\\'s that\\'s where that\\'s where my\\n02:05:17.040 mind goes as well. It seems like he can. But also, why? Why not? Cuz it\\'ll make his dreams even\\n02:05:24.400 bigger. Will it? I don\\'t know. I mean, or will sprinting against a gold medalist, getting in the cage with a\\n02:05:30.159 fighter, getting in the ring with a champion, uh going to that guy\\'s house and and besting him at his own thing,\\n02:05:36.400 like he should keep doing that. He shouldn\\'t he shouldn\\'t go into one\\n02:05:41.840 the lane he\\'s in. I think he\\'s doing pretty well, right? It\\'s almost better losing to the\\n02:05:47.040 fastest man alive by that much or like so I can tell by watching that you like I love potential.\\n02:05:53.280 Mhm. And you see that you\\'re like, \"Oh my god, potential, right? This guy could he could win it all.\" Find a video of him uh sprinting against\\n02:06:00.320 uh that Ashton guy cuz it\\'s it\\'s kind for what? This guy\\'s got the world by the nuts,\\n02:06:06.000 right? He should He should do what he\\'s doing. Exactly what he\\'s saying. I only know him from that appearance at\\n02:06:11.280 the Royal Rumble. like he got booked on the Rumble because he has a big following. I\\'m watching the Rumble. I\\n02:06:16.800 go, \"Who\\'s this ice show speed guy?\" And I go, \"Wow, that kid took a hell of a bump.\" So I know him from\\n02:06:22.159 this Ashton Forbes guy. Now look at the way this guy\\'s built. Oh my.\\n02:06:29.119 He\\'s talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] while he\\'s running. Oh man. And he fell. He\\'s yelling. 40 million people. Is that right? The\\n02:06:35.520 number of views in the corner. 40 million. Unbelievable. Wow. No,\\n02:06:41.760 man. Look at that. Wow. They raced a couple times.\\n02:06:47.280 Yeah, they raced a bunch of times. And the the other didn\\'t that other guy,\\n02:06:53.440 he played football, right? Not in the NFL, but I think like college football or something. Look at this [\\xa0__\\xa0] size of him, too.\\n02:06:59.360 The other guy\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] super jacked. Like, that\\'s his whole thing. His online content is him running, being super\\n02:07:05.679 jacked, and he has to deal with I show speed talking [\\xa0__\\xa0] to him. And he\\'s saying like, \"Look, play some of this.\"\\n02:07:12.000 The first one I slip. Second one, you barely beat me. Let\\'s run it again. Do I got to beat you three times?\\n02:07:17.119 Come on, let\\'s do it. See, see, when I see that, right, let\\'s go again.\\n02:07:22.320 Excuses. What is it? 25. 26.\\n02:07:28.960 That\\'s hilarious. It\\'s talking so much [\\xa0__\\xa0] So, I see this and be like, \"This kid\\n02:07:34.639 should be a wrestler, right? Yeah, because he is athletic and he can talk [\\xa0__\\xa0] and back it up. My god, this kid\\n02:07:41.440 would he would be a 20 time champion. Whatever. No, he should do this. Are they running barefoot on the [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n02:07:47.520 concrete? They have shoes on. Oh, really? Yeah. Uh,\\n02:07:53.119 bad bad decision. I think\\n02:08:01.280 that was pretty close. Yeah, but he started before. Yeah. For me is still lost. For me is still lost.\\n02:08:09.840 Like he should he should be doing that. Yeah. But like you see the sprinting potential. I see the WWE potential. He\\n02:08:16.000 should do neither. He should just do that, right? He\\'s already done. I can\\'t probably want him to do it again.\\n02:08:22.079 Oh my I I think he did a thing. He just went to like the Performance Center and did a thing and like Yeah.\\n02:08:27.119 He\\'s really good. Really good. He\\'s got great instincts. He\\'s got great timing. That\\'s amazing. Yeah. and he\\'s only 20.\\n02:08:34.880 I mean, there\\'s now like this is like full multi- camera really good shooting\\n02:08:40.400 and he\\'s speed versus pros, I think, cuz he\\'s kind of doing that idea you just said. Yeah. Like where he goes he goes to\\n02:08:45.679 people\\'s uh Look at that. 46.2 million subscribers on YouTube. That\\'s wild.\\n02:08:52.000 Yeah. So, I think I think like he should just do that, you know, whatever whatever he\\'s doing. I mean, he\\'s obviously doing it. Does he\\n02:08:58.639 have like a team behind him? That\\'s [\\xa0__\\xa0] now. Probably. Oh, look at that. He\\'s learning how to do flips.\\n02:09:05.520 Oh, that\\'s crazy. So, he\\'s really in it. Yeah. And I think it\\'s just like show up for a few days and then go on to the\\n02:09:11.520 next discipline. Wow. So, he he does everything.\\n02:09:16.719 Smart. Very smart. He spent all summer going to a city every day. Everything was live stream\\n02:09:22.239 for like 24 hours straight. They\\'d go to a city, show up. What\\'s the coolest thing to do in the city and do it? Do it. That\\'s\\n02:09:28.560 like what kind of [\\xa0__\\xa0] was he doing? Go to the fair, go ride all rides, try all the games. There\\'s a bunch of kids following around. Next day they were\\n02:09:35.360 here in Austin going to Terry Blacks. I think he went and did standup with Mark Norman at like in New York City.\\n02:09:41.599 Like that\\'s a very cool he went on stage for a second. That\\'s wild that he\\'s so young, too.\\n02:09:47.520 Only 20. Yeah. That talented and just just brave and courageous and going for it. Like that\\'s\\n02:09:53.920 regardless of what you and I think he\\'s doing exactly what he should be doing, you No, you should just keep doing that. And obviously not getting in his own\\n02:10:00.000 way. Not right at all. All the things you\\'re saying like capitalizing on every opportunity. Story yet to be told.\\n02:10:06.000 Yeah. Story yet still got a still got a lot of life left. Oh yeah. A lot of life left. Yeah.\\n02:10:12.000 We\\'ll see. He\\'s doing he\\'s doing great so far. Yeah. Amazing. Uh I think we wrap this up. It [\\xa0__\\xa0]\\n02:10:19.520 awesome podcast. I really enjoyed it. Thank you very much. It is um it is a real a real big opportunity for you to\\n02:10:26.000 have me on here because uh the the the WWE folks that you have had. I think I\\'m\\n02:10:32.079 still I only got one date left, but I still think I\\'m the active one. I hope uh this experience has been good for you\\n02:10:38.000 guys. Oh, it\\'s been amazing. I hope you have more of the the guys and gals from us in on your show. Absolutely. Every one of them\\'s got a\\n02:10:44.159 great story. Absolutely. Absolutely.
